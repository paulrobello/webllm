# WebLLM Project Status & Roadmap

> **Date:** 2026-04-26
> **Status:** End-to-end browser inference is working for both causal LMs and
> BERT-style encoders (Arctic-Embed). `make bench-full` now drives the
> generative profiles plus the embedding profiles end-to-end into the live
> SQLite-backed dashboard. The dashboard has a dedicated Embeddings section
> (cosine, latency, throughput) and the per-dimension / temperature-sweep /
> Accuracy×Speed charts split Qwen thinking-on vs thinking-off into
> distinct series. The eval suite separates chat-style semantic reasoning
> from true embedding-vector tasks. **The library is now the single source
> of truth for decode**: `engine.chatCompletion` drives [7/8], the
> interactive chat box, and bench mode through the same `Generator.generate`
> that public consumers hit. The parallel decode loop in
> `createSmokeCompletionRunner` is gone. Decode-mode selection is now
> per-step (greedy / topk / full) so steps without active steering state
> stay on the topk fast path even when the config configures steering.
> Current smoke-bench baselines (browser, realistic sampling, 3-trial
> median on 2026-04-25 after qwen3-1.7B characterization landed):
> - tinyllama-1.1b-chat-q4_0: **~105 tok/s decode**
> - qwen3-0.6b-q4f16 (actual: Q8_0), thinking-off: **~85 tok/s decode**
> - qwen3-0.6b-q4f16 (actual: Q8_0), thinking-on: **~93 tok/s decode**
>   (was ~17 — see `3e5be59`: CPU post-filter top-K replaced the
>   full-vocab readback + JS sampling pipeline that was costing
>   ~76 tok/s on Qwen3's 152K vocab)
> - qwen3-1.7b-q4f16 (actual: Q8_0), thinking-on: **~66 tok/s decode**
>   (clean 117-token run; thinking-off 17-token run measured ~59 but
>   is warmup-dominated)
> - smollm2-360m-q4f16 (Q4_0): **~106 tok/s decode** (within noise of
>   TinyLlama-1.1B at the same quant despite 3× fewer params; encode
>   overhead dominates at this scale, matmul takes a back seat — see
>   Active Step §10 wave-1 entry below)
>
> Bench-full coverage at 1.7B landed (6 profiles · 3 off + 3 thinking)
> with overall accuracy 82–89% and per-profile decode (smoke chat
> regression, oneShot tok/s) 45.9–49.8. Smoke-regression numbers
> are lower than `perf.ts` steady-state due to harness overhead;
> compare against `perf.ts` for engine-throughput claims. Dashboard
> on port 8033 has all 6 dots in the accuracy×speed scatter.
>
> llama.cpp `webllm-browser-patches` rebased onto upstream master
> 2026-04-25 (carries `13d36cf89` FA browser unblock + `dd2914dc8`
> SSM_SCAN/set_rows changes). 10 patches now (added a row_norm
> codegen-stability split). No engine regression; FA path doesn't
> engage on Qwen3-1.7B decode shapes — see Active Step §5 for the
> diagnosis. Smoke page now runs a shader-cache warmup after [6/8]
> engine adoption to keep speed measurements steady-state across
> WASM rebuilds.
>
> Decode hotspot diagnostic landed 2026-04-26 (Active Step §6):
> matmul dequant-stub on both Q8 (Qwen3-1.7B) and Q4 (TinyLlama)
> moved `backendMatmulMs` by less than ±5.5% / ±2.5% with dispatch
> count unchanged — both kernels are **memory-bound, not
> compute-bound**. Follow-up src0-vs-src1 discrimination (Active
> Step §7) ran 2026-04-26: **src0 (weights) dominates**, src1
> (activations) is already L2-cached fine. Stub A moved matmul
> -0.8% Q4 / 0.0% Q8; Stub B moved matmul **-20% Q4 / -40% Q8**
> with decode +5.5% / +45%. `OUTPUTS_PER_WG` sweep (§8) confirmed
> OPW=4 locally optimal — bigger OPW only reduces src1 reads
> (already cached); doesn't address src0. Quant lever (§9) tested
> on Qwen3-1.7B: Q4_0 -11.8% matmul / +0.7% tok/s (in noise),
> Q4_K_M -5.8% matmul / -4% tok/s (regression — K-quant compute
> overhead claws back bandwidth savings). Reverted to Q8 baseline
> for dashboard continuity. **Net characterization: matmul ≈ 33%
> of decode time, bandwidth-bound fraction ≈ 40% of matmul on
> Q8 → theoretical ceiling for any pure-bandwidth lever ≈ 13%
> total decode.** Further matmul-kernel tuning is in diminishing-
> returns territory.
>
> **Pivot 2026-04-26: scope expansion to larger models.** Decode
> kernel tuning has bottomed out at the current model fleet (max

## Cumulative Bug Fix History

1. Embedding lookup used `opCpy` Q4_0→F32 (unsupported; replaced with `ggml_get_rows`).
2. Leaf input data (`posTensor`, `tokenIdsTensor`, mask) must be written with `backendTensorSet` *after* `backendAllocCtxTensors`.
3. SPM tokenizer: ▁ normalization (encode + decode), code-point iteration, byte-fallback via `<0xHH>` text.
4. KV writes were orphaned by `graph_build_forward_expand` (unreachable from logits) — now explicitly expanded per layer.
5. KV writes ordered BEFORE attention reads in the graph node list.
6. RMSNorm gamma was never multiplied in — now applied at all three norm sites (attn, ffn, final).
7. Custom `GGML_OP_DIAG_MASK_INF` shader broken past head 0; later replaced by `ggml_soft_max_ext` with explicit causal mask tensor.
8. **V cache permute used wrong `ggml_permute` arguments** — silent shape mismatch in subsequent cpy scrambled V values. Fixed `(2, 0, 1, 3)` → `(1, 2, 0, 3)`.
9. WASM build -O1 → -O3 (3.4MB → 1.77MB).
10. Sampling wired in via `Sampler` class (temp / top-k / top-p / repetition penalty).
11. `ggml_soft_max_ext` + `op_get_rows` WASM bindings added.
12. Multi-turn chat garbled output — TinyLlama without a system message interprets Zephyr markers as comparison operators. Fixed by auto-prepending DEFAULT_SYSTEM in `formatChatPrompt`.
13. GPU TOP_K decode path reshaped logits as `[vocab, 1]` before `ggml_get_rows`; ggml gathers along row dimension, so the graph produced `[vocab, topK]` and later failed reshape assertions. Fixed by reshaping logits to `[1, vocab]` before `opGetRows`.
14. Dashboard Temperature sweep hot series produced data but could render invisibly because `CHART_COLORS.red` was missing. Fixed by extracting shared temperature-sweep data construction and defining the hot color as `#f85149`.
15. **Encoder V permute tripped `ggml_mul_mat`'s `is_transposed` assertion** — `permute(v3, 1,2,0,3)` produced the right logical shape `[N, headDim, nHeads]` but left `nb[0] > nb[1]`. Wrapped in `opCont` to match llama.cpp's no-KV-cache BERT path.
16. **BERT WordPiece vocab follows llama.cpp's phantom-space convention** — `convert_hf_to_gguf.py::BertModel.set_vocab` rewrites the HF vocab so word-initial tokens gain a `▁` (U+2581) prefix and `##xyz` continuations have the `##` stripped. Our tokenizer was looking up `happy` / `##ful` (HF style) and missing every entry, producing `[CLS][UNK][SEP]` for every input. Rewrote `wpSubword` and `decodeWordPiece` to match `llm_tokenizer_wpm_session`. HF golden fixture in `tests/wordpiece-golden.test.ts` now guards it.
17. **`ggml-webgpu` silently no-op'd `GGML_OP_NORM`** — only `RMS_NORM` and `L2_NORM` were in `supports_op`, so LayerNorm fell through and the result buffer kept its zero-init contents. Combined with `GGML_CPU=OFF` (no scheduler fallback) every encoder forward produced bit-identical output regardless of input. Added a `LAYER_NORM` variant to `row_norm.wgsl` (Σx + Σx² in one pass), registered the pipeline, and dispatched `GGML_OP_NORM` through `ggml_webgpu_row_norm`. See `docs/LLAMA_CPP_PATCHES.md` patch #9.
18. **Bench-full smoke page hard-coded the causal-LM path at step [4/8]** — `ModelInference.loadWeights` failed on BERT GGUFs with `Weight "output_norm.weight" not found`. Page now branches on `arch === "bert"` and uses `EncoderInference`, skipping KV cache / generation / reference-encoder steps with explanatory pass logs.
19. **HF downloader picked Q4_K_M for arctic-embed** because the MLC-style `q0f32` defaultQuant didn't match any file in the GGUF repo and `q4_k_m` was first in the fallback list. Added a `ggufFilePattern?: string` field to `BenchmarkModel`; arctic-embed pins `"f16"` and the picker checks it ahead of `defaultQuant`.
20. **Tokenizer.encode("") returned `[]` for WORDPIECE** — bypassed the `[CLS] ... [SEP]` framing via an unconditional empty-string short-circuit in `encode()`. WORDPIECE now always frames; other tokenizer types keep returning `[]`.
21. **Score-over-time chart was blank despite a populated DB** — `renderSeriesChart` was defined but never invoked from the `render()` loop, so the panel always showed the bar-empty placeholder. Adding the call to the render loop (between `renderFinishChart` and `renderTable`) fixed it. Also fixed: `seriesLoaded` was sticky after the first fetch, so SSE-delivered evals were invisible to the chart; now reset on every `eval_complete` event. The category x-axis was missing its `labels` array, so even when called the points had nowhere to plot — now built from the sorted union of timestamps.
22. **Dashboard charts keyed on `modelId` collapsed Qwen thinking-on/off** — Temperature sweep, per-dimension grouped, and Accuracy×Speed scatter all shared a key for both Qwen modes; latest-wins silently overwrote one with the other. Group keys now include `thinking`; series labels gain a `" (think)"` suffix when thinking is on so non-thinking-capable models keep their existing labels.
23. **`engine.generateStream` qwen3-chatml wiring diverged from the smoke loop in 4 places** discovered while consolidating onto the library. Effects: (a) `maskedTokensWhileThinking` and `maskedTokensAfterThinkingUntilAnswer` were missing `<|endoftext|>`, so the model could emit it mid-think and either get a stray stop or pollute the chain-of-thought; (b) `maskedTokensAfterAnswerStarts` mistakenly included `<|im_end|>`, which is the chat EOS — the model could not terminate normally during the visible answer and qwen3 thinking-on always ran to `max-tokens`; (c) `<|endoftext|>` wasn't auto-added as a stop token; (d) the smoke loop's first-post-`</think>` leading-whitespace guard (forces `</think>` to be followed by a token starting with whitespace) had no library counterpart. Fixed all four; added `requireLeadingWhitespaceAfterThinking` to `GenerationConfig` for parity, and threaded the seed through `engine.generateStream`'s internal `Sampler` (added `CompletionConfig.seed`) so smoke runs are reproducible through the public API.
24. **`Generator.generate` computed `gpuMode` once, statically, before the decode loop** — `requiresFullLogitsSteering = (any qwen3 mask set configured)` forced `gpuMode = "full"` for the entire run. Once the smoke loop migrated onto the library, qwen3 thinking-off ran at ~17 tok/s on the full path instead of ~83 tok/s on the topk path, even on steps where no steering state was active. Replaced with per-step dynamic selection: `greedy` if sampler is greedy + no penalty; `topk` if `sampler.topK > 0` AND no current steering state (`thinkDepth === 0 && !waitingForVisibleAnswer && !hasVisibleAnswerText`); else `full`. The smoke loop's old code had this dynamic check inline; the library now matches.

## Debug Tools

`src/inference/model-inference.ts` has instrumented debug helpers. From the browser console on `smoke-test/real-model.html`:

```js
await window.inference.debugReadEmbeddingRow(1);  // BOS

window.inference.resetKVCache();
await window.inference.forward(new Int32Array([22172]), new Int32Array([0]));
await window.inference.debugReadKCache(0, 64*4, 0);
await window.inference.debugReadVCache(0, 64*4, 0);

await window.inference.debugReadNormWeight("attn0", 8);

await window.inference.debugLayerOutput(
  22172, 0, "layer_output"
  // or: "pre_attn" | "attn_normed" | "attn_q" | "attn_k" | "attn_v"
  //     | "attn_out" | "post_attn" | "ffn_normed" | "ffn_gate" | "ffn_up"
  //     | "ffn_hidden" | "ffn_out"
);
```

`smoke-test/real-model.html` stashes `window.{inference, tokenizer, parsedModel}` for console use.

# Inference Performance Optimizations

Baseline (pre-optimization): ~44 tok/s decode, ~130 ms prefill on TinyLlama 1.1B
Q4_0 via Emscripten WebGPU in-browser.

**Steady-state decode baselines (2026-04-25, non-profile, realistic
sampler):** TinyLlama Q4_0 ~107 tok/s · Qwen3 0.6B thinking-off ~83
tok/s · Qwen3 0.6B thinking-on ~17 tok/s · Qwen3 1.7B thinking-on
~66 tok/s · (Qwen3 1.7B thinking-off measured at ~59 tok/s but on a
17-token run that's warmup-dominated; the thinking-on number is the
clean steady-state at this size). These are the canonical numbers to
compare new perf work against.

**Quant caveat:** model IDs `qwen3-*-q4f16` actually resolve to
`Qwen3-*-Q8_0.gguf` files (610 MB at 0.6B, 1.7 GB at 1.7B) because no
`ggufFilePattern` is pinned and the picker fallback hits Q8 first. So
within-Qwen3 comparisons across sizes are clean (both Q8), but
TinyLlama-Q4 vs Qwen3-Q8 absolute matmul ms cross two variables —
read matmul *fraction of graph time* across families, not absolute ms.
Cleanup item: pin `ggufFilePattern: "Q4_K"` (or similar) on the qwen3
entries in `eval/models.ts` if Q4 comparisons become load-bearing.

**Profile-mode hotspot ranking (2026-04-25, `--profile`).** Captured
through `make smoke-bench PERF_RUNS=3` after fixing three latent
harness bugs (`953c560`) that had been masking trace collection since
the consolidation landed. `--profile` enables ggml-webgpu's detailed
backend timing and perturbs throughput measurably:

| Profile          | Steady-state | Profile-mode | Perturbation |
|------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| TinyLlama Q4_0   | ~107 tok/s   | 76 tok/s     | -29%         |
| Qwen3-0.6 off    | ~83 tok/s    | 55 tok/s     | -34%         |
| Qwen3-0.6 on     | ~17 tok/s    | 14.6 tok/s   | -14%         |
| Qwen3-1.7 off    | ~59 tok/s*   | 41.5 tok/s   | -29%         |
| Qwen3-1.7 on     | ~66 tok/s    | 43.2 tok/s   | -34%         |

\* warmup-dominated 17-token run; trust the thinking-on number for the
clean 1.7B steady-state.

Cite steady-state numbers for throughput claims; cite profile-mode
ratios for hotspot ranking. Mixing the two is what derailed the
"Apr-23 regression" investigation.

Per-step decode breakdown by mode (medians from the runs above):

| Bucket (ms/step)        | TinyLlama topk | Qwen3-0.6 topk | Qwen3-0.6 full | Qwen3-1.7 topk-off | Qwen3-1.7 topk-on |
|-------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|--------------------|-------------------|

| downloadResultMs        |  1.20 ( 9.1%)  |  1.37 ( 8.8%)  |  0.93 ( 3.9%)  |  1.00 ( 4.7%)      |  1.10 ( 5.6%)     |
| build + alloc + upload  |  0.26 ( 2.0%)  |  0.36 ( 2.3%)  |  0.35 ( 1.5%)  |  0.36 ( 1.7%)      |  0.32 ( 1.5%)     |
| **totalMs**             | **13.14**      | **15.66**      | **23.93**      | **20.40**          | **20.60**         |

Backend attribution (% of `graphComputeMs`, profile mode only):

| Field                    | TinyLlama topk | Qwen3-0.6 topk | Qwen3-0.6 full | Qwen3-1.7 topk-off | Qwen3-1.7 topk-on |
|--------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| backendMatmulMs          | 3.85 (33.0%)   | 4.05 (29.1%)   | 6.31 (27.9%)   | 6.68 (33.8%)       | 6.88 (34.2%)      |
| backendEncodeOverheadMs  | 2.71 (23.2%)   | 4.07 (29.2%)   | 3.53 (15.6%)   | 4.20 (22.4%)       | 3.90 (19.9%)      |

| backendDispatchCount     | 450/token      | 629/token      | 619/token      | 629/token          | 629/token         |

Headlines:
- **Decode is graph-compute-bound across every profile** (~89–95% of
  step time). Readback is a 4–9% slice; further async-readback work
  has tiny headroom.
- **Dispatch count is architecture-invariant within Qwen3** (629/token
  for both 0.6B and 1.7B topk paths). The earlier "graph-shape reduction
  has more leverage on Qwen3" framing was right about the dispatch
  delta vs TinyLlama (629 vs 450); what we now know is that *encode
  overhead's absolute cost is ~flat* (4.07 → 4.20 ms across the 2.83×
  param jump). Its *fraction* of graph time drops with model size
  (29.2% → 22.4%) — i.e. the encode lever has *diminishing*
  trajectory at scale.
- **Matmul scales sub-linearly with parameter count** within Qwen3:
  4.05 → 6.88 ms (1.7×) for 2.83× params, consistent with bandwidth-
  bound GEMV on Q8 weights. Matmul share grows from 29.1% → 34.2%, so
  matmul kernel work has *growing* trajectory at scale and is now the
  clear lead bucket on Qwen3-1.7B (33–34%) by ~12pp over encode.
- **§2's topk fix holds at scale.** Thinking-on at 1.7B routes 342/348
  steps (98%) through topk; the remaining 6 full-path steps add ~3 ms/
  step but contribute negligibly to wall time. Cost-per-token is at
  near-parity with thinking-off at this size.
- **Decision criteria don't cleanly hit the >40% / >25% / ~30%
  thresholds** in TODO §4. Matmul 33–34% is below the >40% rule;
  encode 20–22% is below the >25% rule; "balanced ~30%" is closest
  but matmul leads by a margin. The recommendation below is a
  trajectory call (encode flat-absolute, matmul still scaling), not
  a threshold match.
- **Consolidation tightened TinyLlama dispatches and matmul share**
  vs the stale 2026-04-22 numbers (489 → 450 dispatches/token, matmul
  share 40.4% → 33.0%). Treat that as a quiet consolidation win, not
  a headline.

Items in rough order of expected impact. Each entry explains the idea, where
the code lives today, the expected win, and the risk/tradeoff.

---

## High impact

### 1. Decode graph reuse (deferred)
- **Where**: `src/inference/model-inference.ts::forward()`
- **Today**: every call to `forward()` calls `ctxCreate`, builds the full
  ~440-op graph, calls `backendAllocCtxTensors`, uploads leaf inputs, runs
  compute, then `ctxFree`s. For a decode step with `nTokens=1` the graph
  shape is identical across steps.
- **Change**: cache the graph for `nTokens=1` decode. Only update:
  - leaf inputs (`posTensor`, `tokenIdsTensor`, mask row for current position)
  - the K/V cache offsets (encoded into the graph nodes via `pastLen * kNb1`
    constants, so this needs either graph reuse with runtime offset or
    rebuilding just the KV views each step)
- **Expected**: 2–5× decode throughput. The JS-side graph construction +
  WASM asyncify round trip is currently a meaningful chunk of per-step cost.
- **Risk**: the ggml graph stores absolute offsets inside view tensors.
  Reusing the graph requires either:
  - Adding a C-side helper that mutates view tensor offsets in place, or
  - Refactoring KV cache layout so writes always go to a fixed slot and the
    "real" position is a permutation applied separately, or
  - Pre-building graphs for every possible past-length (memory hungry)
- **Profile measurement (2026-04-21):**
  - mean total per decode step: 16.75 ms
  - ctxCreate: 0.00 ms (0.0%)
  - buildGraph: 0.21 ms (1.3%)
  - backendAlloc: 0.05 ms (0.3%)
  - uploadLeaves: 0.02 ms (0.1%)
  - graphCompute: 6.92 ms (41.3%)
  - downloadLogits: 9.53 ms (56.9%)
  - teardown: 0.02 ms (0.1%)
  - Non-GPU overhead (ctxCreate + buildGraph + backendAlloc + teardown) = 1.7%.
- **Status**: deferred. Big structural change relative to its current
  expected win at 17.5 ms/step. Revisit if we can measure that graph
  building (not GPU compute) is actually the bottleneck.
- **Phase A skipped:** GPU compute + logits download dominate; moving graph
  build to C can at best claw back ~1.7% and isn't worth the C-side
  maintenance burden.

### 2. Re-enable batched compute passes in the WebGPU backend ✅ DONE
- **Where**: `~/Repos/llama.cpp/ggml/src/ggml-webgpu/ggml-webgpu.cpp`
- **Fix**: flipped `batch_compute_passes` to `true`. Safe now that
  overlap-only conflict detection (item 3) doesn't schedule inter-dispatch
  CopyBufferToBuffer calls for most ops.
- **Actual gain**: marginal on top of item 3 (most of the 33% came from
  item 3). Still worth keeping for larger models where driver overhead
  of many compute passes would dominate.

### 3. Refine buffer-conflict detection (overlap-only) ✅ DONE
- **Where**: `~/Repos/llama.cpp/ggml/src/ggml-webgpu/ggml-webgpu.cpp`
  `__EMSCRIPTEN__` block in `ggml_backend_webgpu_build_multi`.
- **Was**: created a temp GPU buffer for EVERY same-buffer-different-offset
  binding pair, even when the ranges didn't actually overlap. WebGPU's
  validation only rejects overlapping ranges, not disjoint ones.
- **Fix**: added an `overlap` check (`!(a_end <= b_start || b_end <= a_start)`)
  before creating a temp buffer. Most attention/FFN op bindings turned out
  to be disjoint slices of the shared graph buffer.
- **Actual gain**: **+28% decode throughput** (44 → 56 tok/s). The bulk of
  the original overhead was unnecessary `CopyBufferToBuffer` calls.

- **Where**: `ggml-webgpu.cpp::ggml_backend_webgpu_device_supports_op`
  under `GGML_OP_FLASH_ATTN_EXT` — currently `#ifndef __EMSCRIPTEN__`
  on our patch branch (rebase point `68f1738d5`).
- **Was blocked on**: emdawnwebgpu does NOT expose
  `wgpu::FeatureName::ChromiumExperimentalSubgroupMatrix`; llama.cpp's
  original FA shaders required subgroup-matrix.
- **Unblock**: upstream commit `13d36cf89` ("ggml-webgpu: enable
  FLASH_ATTN_EXT on browser without subgroup matrix", #22199, merged
  2026-04-24) adds a tile / vec FA fallback that does NOT require
  subgroup-matrix. Path forward is now a rebase, not waiting on
  Chrome.
- **Expected gain (decode):** modest. Decode-mode attention is N=1,
  so the [seq, seq] matrix that FA avoids materializing is tiny. The
  per-token win comes from fewer dispatches (likely 3–5 fewer per
  layer, ~100/token on Qwen3) reducing encode overhead by ~0.5–1 ms,
  plus a small `backendAttentionMs` saving. Realistic ceiling at
  decode: 3–5%. Not a 10% lever on its own.
- **Expected gain (prefill):** substantial. FA's main win is for
  long-prompt prefill where attention matrix size scales with seq².
  If prefill latency / TTFT becomes a target, this is the lever.
- **Action**: rebase the patch branch to a point at-or-after
  `13d36cf89`, drop the `#ifndef __EMSCRIPTEN__` guard, re-verify
  smoke + perf, capture the dispatch-count delta on Qwen3-1.7B as
  the headline measurement. Rebase carries non-trivial maintenance
  cost (~9 patches; see `docs/LLAMA_CPP_PATCHES.md`).

### 5. Fused SwiGLU op ✅ DONE
- **Where**: `src/inference/model-inference.ts` FFN section.
- **Actual gain**: +1–2% (58 → ~58.5 tok/s). Modest — FFN compute is
  dominated by the three mul_mats, not by silu/mul. Kept for cleanliness.

### 6. F16 KV cache ❌ NET LOSS AT SHORT CONTEXT
- **Tried**: switched K and V to `F16`. WebGPU backend handled F16×F32
  mul_mat correctly — no correctness regression.
- **Measured**: **-7.7%** decode throughput (55.3 tok/s vs 59.9 baseline).
  F16×F32 mul_mat not as fast as F32×F32 for small matrices, and F32→F16
  conversion on every KV write adds dispatch overhead at short contexts.
- **Reverted**: code stays F32. Reconsider for long-context workloads
  (1000+ tokens) where bandwidth savings on attention reads will overtake
  write-path overhead.

## Low impact / polish

### 7. Skip redundant `opCont` calls ✅ DONE
- **Where**: K/V cache writes in `forward()`.
- **Actual gain**: +0–2% on top of item 5. Still worth keeping: fewer
  dispatches, cleaner code.

### 8. Skip mask tensor for nTokens=1 decode ✅ DONE (partial)
- **Where**: `forward()` mask allocation + upload + softmax_ext call.
- **Actual gain**: flat. Still a cleanup. Pre-allocating mask at
  `initKVCache` time deferred.

### 9. Reduce JS↔WASM boundary crossings ✅ DONE
- **Where**: `src/wasm/webgpu-bridge.cpp` + `src/inference/ggml-wasm.ts`
  + `forward()` in `model-inference.ts`.
- **Change**: added `backend_tensor_set3` in C bridge — single bundled WASM
  call for pos + ids + mask instead of 2–3 separate hops.
- **Actual gain**: **+5–7% decode throughput** (55.6 → 58.7 tok/s median).

### 10. Benchmark the current pipeline ✅ DONE
- **Where**: `eval/perf.ts` + `make smoke-bench` + `make bench-inference-save`.
- **Current Task 5 profiled investigation baseline**: 93.5 tok/s on the
  profiled TinyLlama-1.1B Q4_0 browser run (`PERF_RUNS=3`), with median-run
  wall time 2027 ms, `graphComputeMs` mean 9.96 ms, and `downloadResultMs`
  mean 0.62 ms. Read this as a profiling baseline for hotspot ranking, not as
  the new steady-state browser throughput baseline.
- `make smoke-bench` — end-to-end: builds WASM+JS, starts server, launches
  agentchrome (headed), runs 3 perf iterations with `--profile`, cleans up.
  All smoke targets (`smoke-serve`, `smoke-open`, `smoke-run`, `smoke-bench`)
  depend on `smoke-test` for fresh builds.

### 11. GPU-side ARGMAX/TOP_K logits reduction ✅ DONE (negligible gain)
- **Where**: `src/wasm/webgpu-bridge.cpp` (C bridge), `src/inference/ggml-wasm.ts`
  (TS bindings), `src/inference/model-inference.ts::forwardDecode()`,
  `src/inference/generation.ts` (decode loop routing),
  `src/inference/sampler.ts::sampleFromTopK()`,
  `src/core/engine.ts` (wiring), `smoke-test/real-model.html` (both code paths).
- **What**: Added `ggml_argmax` and `ggml_top_k` to the WASM bridge. New
  `forwardDecode()` method builds the same transformer graph but appends
  ARGMAX/TOP_K tail ops, downloading 4 bytes (greedy) or k×8 bytes (topk)
  instead of 128KB (32K×float32) full logits. Generation loop auto-selects
  mode: greedy (temp=0, no penalty), topk (topK>0), or full (fallback).
  Smoke test step 7 and chat handler both use the greedy path.
- **Actual gain**: **+0.5%** (58.7 → 59.0 tok/s). Negligible.
- **Why**: The readback bottleneck is synchronization latency, not data size.
  At the time of measurement, `downloadFromTensor()` still paid queue/map wait
  latency that dominated the ~9.5ms readback regardless of whether the payload
  was 4 bytes or 128KB. Reducing data size only saved the final memcpy
  (~0.01ms for 128KB).
- **Follow-up completed**: the browser stack now has a real request-based async
  readback path:
  - `~/Repos/llama.cpp/ggml/include/ggml-webgpu.h`
  - `~/Repos/llama.cpp/ggml/src/ggml-webgpu/ggml-webgpu.cpp`
  - `src/wasm/webgpu-bridge.cpp`
  - `src/inference/ggml-wasm.ts::downloadFromTensor()`
  This adds backend `begin / poll / finish / cancel` support, wires it through
  the WASM bridge, and uses heap allocation safely across async boundaries.
- **Current status**: correctness/integration is fixed, browser smoke passes,
  and the latest profiled run shows the completion-driven path has reduced
  `downloadResultMs` to a 0.64 ms mean. Readback is now a smaller slice of
  decode latency than the rest of the step.
- **Infrastructure value**: The ARGMAX/TOP_K bridge functions, `forwardDecode()`,
  generation-loop routing, and the new async readback request API are all useful
  foundations for the next round of latency-hiding work. The
  `sampleFromTopK()` sampler method enables CPU sampling on GPU-reduced
  candidate sets for temperature > 0.

## Dashboard & Visualization

Live bench dashboard at `smoke-test/dashboard.*` (served by
`eval/live-server.ts` on port 8033). Each section below is independently
shippable on top of the existing eval/run data — no new bench metadata
needs to be collected.

### 12. Convert existing charts to a proper charting library ✅ DONE
- **Where**: `smoke-test/dashboard.js`, `smoke-test/dashboard.html`,
  `smoke-test/dashboard.css`, `smoke-test/vendor/chart.umd.min.js`.
- **Done**: introduced self-hosted Chart.js 4 UMD and converted the main
  dashboard charts to managed Chart.js instances with dark-theme colors,
  legends, tooltips, and dynamic chart-host sizing.
- **Follow-up**: use `make vendor-refresh` after bumping `chart.js` to refresh
  the vendored browser bundle.

### 13. Accuracy × Speed scatter chart ✅ DONE
- **Where**: `smoke-test/dashboard.js::renderScatterChart`,
  `smoke-test/dashboard.html`.
- **What**: one dot per profile. X = mean tok/s, Y = eval `overall`.
- **Answers**: "which profile should we actually ship?"

### 14. Per-dimension grouped bars per model ✅ DONE
- **Where**: `smoke-test/dashboard.js::renderDimGroupedChart`,
  `smoke-test/dashboard.html`.
- **What**: one row per model (cold profile only); grouped bars for
  `tool-calling / reasoning / instruction-following / semantic-reasoning`.
- **Answers**: "which model do I pick for workload X?"

### 15. Temperature sweep per dimension ✅ DONE
- **Where**: `smoke-test/dashboard.js::renderTempSweepChart`,
  `smoke-test/dashboard-charts.js`, `tests/dashboard-charts.test.ts`.
- **What**: per (model, dimension), cold / warm / hot grouped bars.
- **Answers**: "is temperature hurting me on dimension X?"
- **Regression covered**: the hot bucket now has explicit data + color coverage
  so it cannot disappear silently.

### 16. Thinking on vs off delta (Qwen) ✅ DONE
- **Where**: `smoke-test/dashboard.js::renderThinkingDeltaChart`,
  `smoke-test/dashboard.html`.
- **What**: two-bar pairs per dimension comparing Qwen thinking off/on at
  matched temperature.
- **Answers**: "is thinking worth the extra decode time, and on which
  dimensions?"

### 17. Time-to-first-token (prefill latency) chart ✅ DONE
- **Where**: `smoke-test/dashboard.js::renderTtftChart`,
  `smoke-test/dashboard.html`.
- **What**: horizontal bar chart of `oneShot.prefillMs` per profile.
- **Answers**: "how long until the first token for each profile?"

### 18. Finish reason breakdown ✅ DONE
- **Where**: `smoke-test/dashboard.js::renderFinishChart`,
  `smoke-test/dashboard.html`.
- **What**: stacked horizontal bars showing `eos / max-tokens / stop-token /
  error / unknown` counts by profile.
- **Answers**: "is this profile producing clean completions, or is it
  running off the end?"

### 19. Score over time (regression detection) ✅ DONE
- **Where**: `smoke-test/dashboard.js::renderSeriesChart`,
  `eval/live-db.ts::loadEvalSeries`, `eval/live-server.ts` `/evals/series`.
- **What**: line chart of `overall` across successive eval runs by profile.
- **Answers**: "did a code change regress anything?"

### 20. Quantization comparison (future — requires multi-quant models)
- **Where**: new panel.
- **What**: same model at q4 vs q8 vs f16 — accuracy delta vs speed delta.
- **Blocker**: today every entry in `eval/models.ts` has exactly one
  quant. Needs multi-quant registrations to be meaningful. Deferred.

### 21. Dedicated Embeddings dashboard section ✅ DONE
- **Where**: `smoke-test/dashboard.html` (new section divider + three
  panels), `smoke-test/dashboard.js`
  (`renderEmbeddingCosineChart` / `renderEmbeddingLatencyChart` /
  `renderEmbeddingThroughputChart`),
  `smoke-test/dashboard-charts.js`
  (`buildEmbeddingCosineChartData` / `buildEmbeddingLatencyChartData` /
  `buildEmbeddingThroughputChartData`),
  `tests/dashboard-charts.test.ts`.
- **What**: separate "Embeddings" section at the bottom of the dashboard
  with three panels — per-task cosine similarity, median ms-per-text
  latency, and texts/sec throughput. Per-dimension grouped chart now
  excludes embedding-only evals and drops the `embedding` column so
  generative-model rows aren't cluttered.
- **Answers**: "how fast and how good is each embedding model?"

### 22. Accuracy × Speed model colour key ✅ DONE
- **Where**: `smoke-test/dashboard.js::renderScatterChart`.
- **What**: scatter dots are grouped by `(modelId, thinking)` into one
  dataset per model+mode, each with its own colour from an 8-stop
  palette. The chart's top legend acts as the colour key. Stable colour
  assignment via sorted keys.
- **Answers**: "which dot is which model?" without needing to hover.

---

## Won't-do (for now)

- **Smaller quants (Q2_K / Q3_K)**: quality/speed tradeoff, not a pipeline improvement.
- **Speculative decoding**: requires a drafter model; large project.
- **Custom kernel fusion beyond GLU**: huge effort, marginal win.

---

## Next Steps

### Decode hotspot decision / rebaseline (2026-04-22 Task 5)
- **Current hotspot:** matmul path tuning remains the lead target.
- **Profile-mode hotspot evidence:** `make smoke-bench PERF_RUNS=3
  PERF_MODEL=tinyllama-1.1b-chat-q4_0` reported median **93.5 tok/s**, median
  run **184 ms prefill**, **331 ms decode**, and **2027 ms wall time** for the
  full page completion. Across 90 single-token greedy decode traces,
  `graphComputeMs` averaged **9.96 ms / 91.8%** of step time while
  `downloadResultMs` averaged **0.62 ms / 5.7%**. Because this came from
  `--profile` mode, use it for hotspot ranking and direction, not as a new
  steady-state throughput claim.
- **Backend attribution:** `backendMatmulMs` averaged **4.02 ms / 40.4% of
  graph time**, ahead of `backendEncodeOverheadMs` (**2.81 ms / 28.2%**) and
  `backendAttentionMs` (**0.40 ms / 4.0%**). `backendDispatchCount` stayed at
  **489** per token; that supports the encode/dispatch-overhead suspicion but
  is not itself a timed bottleneck metric.
- **Decision:** keep structural follow-up deferred. If perf work resumes, the
  current profiled traces suggest keeping the next optimization pass narrow and
  targeting matmul first, with encode overhead as the secondary decode-compute
  suspect.
- **Update (2026-04-22):** Matmul follow-up attempt (increase legacy Q outputs per wg) showed no meaningful retained gain and was reverted.
- **Update (2026-04-25):** baseline moved to ~110 tok/s after the GPU TOP_K
  smoke-loop wiring (commit `9156deb`).
- **Update (2026-04-25, library-as-source-of-truth consolidation):** the
  smoke loop has been deleted and replaced with a thin
  `engine.chatCompletion` adapter; `Generator.generate` now picks the
  decode mode dynamically per step. Numbers in this section pre-date
  both 2026-04-25 changes — **all bucket percentages here are stale**.
  Re-profile first; see "Active next steps §1" below.

### Completed on 2026-04-24

- Fixed GPU TOP_K row gathering by reshaping logits to `[1, vocab]` before
  `opGetRows`.
- Added `WEBLLM_ASSERTIONS` / `wasm-build-debug` for preserving WASM abort
  diagnostics when needed.
- Added the `semantic-reasoning` eval dimension and moved chat-style semantic
  tasks out of the true embedding-vector track.
- Added cosine-similarity scoring helpers and regression tests for embedding
  vector scoring.
- Captured eval sampler/context params so the dashboard can bucket temperature
  and show run details.
- Migrated live dashboard charts to self-hosted Chart.js and implemented
  accuracy × speed, per-dimension grouped bars, temperature sweep, Qwen
  thinking deltas, TTFT, finish reasons, and score-over-time.
- Fixed the Temperature sweep hot bucket rendering regression with shared
  chart-data tests.
- Documented model support and follow-up roadmap in `docs/MODEL_SUPPORT.md`.
- Wired the public streaming APIs (`WebLLM.generateStream()` and
  `WebLLM.chatCompletion()`) through `Generator` + `InferenceSession`, with
  stop-token handling, abort metadata, Qwen thinking controls, and tests in
  `tests/engine-streaming-api.test.ts`.
- 2026-04-24: Encoder forward pass shipped. `WebLLM.embed(modelId, text)`
  drives a BERT-style bidirectional graph (input embed + post-norm
  attention + GeLU FFN, mean/CLS pooling, L2-normalized output) on the
  Arctic-Embed-s GGUF; smoke step `[8/8]` passes with `cosine('happy',
  'joyful') ≈ 0.77`. Bring-up uncovered three load-bearing fixes:
  V-permute → `opCont` to satisfy `ggml_mul_mat`'s `is_transposed`
  assertion; tokenizer rewritten for llama.cpp's phantom-space BERT
  vocab convention (HF golden fixture in `tests/wordpiece-golden.test.ts`
  guards it); and `GGML_OP_NORM` added to the patched ggml-webgpu
  backend (commit `68f1738d5`, see `docs/LLAMA_CPP_PATCHES.md` patch #9).

### Completed on 2026-04-25

- Wired arctic-embed-s/m profiles into `make bench-full`. New
  `embedding?: boolean` flag on `SmokeProfile`; `bench.ts` skips the
  `chat-smoke` (speed) phase for embedding profiles; `browser-eval.ts`
  auto-restricts embedding-only models to the embedding dimension.
  `eval/models.ts` gains a `ggufFilePattern?: string` field so the HF
  downloader pins the verified F16 GGUF instead of falling through to
  Q4_K_M. `smoke-test/real-model-page.js` branches on `arch === "bert"`
  and routes through `EncoderInference`; `engine.adoptPreloadedModel`
  now accepts either inference type. End-to-end:
  `8/8 tasks passing · overall 93%` for arctic-embed-s.
- HF golden WordPiece fixture: `scripts/extract-bert-vocab.ts` dumps
  the real Arctic-Embed-s vocab (30522 tokens) to JSON;
  `scripts/generate-bert-golden.py` generates HF reference encodings
  for 16 probe strings (single words, multi-word, subword splits,
  casing, accents, punctuation carve-outs, empty string);
  `tests/wordpiece-golden.test.ts` asserts byte-for-byte parity.
- Dashboard restructure:
  - New "Embeddings" section with cosine, median latency, and
    throughput panels.
  - Per-dimension grouped chart now excludes embedding-only evals and
    drops the `embedding` column; renders `null` (not `0`) for
    dimensions a model wasn't scored on.
  - Temperature sweep, per-dimension grouped, and Accuracy×Speed scatter
    now key on `(modelId, thinking)` so Qwen thinking-on and
    thinking-off render as distinct rows / colours.
  - Accuracy × Speed scatter coloured by model with the chart's own top
    legend acting as the colour key.
  - Score over time: wired into the render loop (was defined but never
    called), category x-axis given a labels array built from the sorted
    union of timestamps, `seriesLoaded` cache invalidated on every
    `eval_complete` event.
- TODO.md records an Apr-23 ~50% smoke-bench tok/s drop; bisect attributed
  it to the encoder-innocent commit `5542bef`. See Next Steps §1 for the
  2026-04-25 root-cause finding (sampler-config change in the smoke page,
  not an engine regression).
- Re-baselined item 11 with the `?slowpath=1` URL gate (temporary, not
  committed): full 32 K-vocab readback costs only ~0.1 ms/token over the
  4-byte ARGMAX readback even post-async-readback. The "negligible gain"
  framing for `forwardDecode("greedy")` is correct. The entire ~10 ms/token
  gap between greedy and realistic sampling lives in the JS sampling
  pipeline.
- `perf(smoke): route realistic-sampler decode through GPU TOP_K path`
  (commit `9156deb`). Added a topk middle branch in
  `smoke-test/real-model-smoke.js::createSmokeCompletionRunner` that
  calls `inference.forwardDecode(..., "topk", sampler.topK)` and feeds
  the reduced indices/values into `sampler.sampleFromTopK(...)`. Gated
  to skip when qwen masking/thinking state is active. **Measured impact
  (TinyLlama Q4_0, 3 trials median): 52.9 → 110.7 tok/s (2.1×)**;
  recovers 96% of the way to the greedy upper bound (114.8 tok/s).
  Qwen3 thinking-off also benefits (~76 tok/s); thinking-on routes
  through the unchanged full path (~16.6 tok/s).
- **TODO §2 done — library is now the single source of truth for
  decode** (committed as `6865a2c`). The smoke decode loop
  in `createSmokeCompletionRunner` was a 200-line duplicate of
  `Generator.generate` that silently dropped throughput when the topk
  fast path landed on one side but not the other. Consolidation steps:
  - **Library fixes (Phase 1):** `engine.generateStream` qwen3 wiring
    parity (bug-fix #23 above); `requireLeadingWhitespaceAfterThinking`
    added to `GenerationConfig` and wired through
    `Generator.generate`'s post-`</think>` sampling guard.
  - **Library extension (Phase 2A):** `CompletionConfig.seed` added to
    `src/core/chat-types.ts`; `engine.generateStream` threads it into
    the internal `Sampler({ ... seed })` construction.
  - **Library refactor (Phase 3):** dynamic per-step decode-mode
    selection in `Generator.generate` (bug-fix #24 above).
  - **Smoke-side rewrite (Phase 2B):**
    `smoke-test/real-model-smoke.js::createSmokeCompletionRunner` now
    a ~50-line adapter over `engine.chatCompletion`. Deleted 11 dead
    helpers (`getForbiddenReentryTokens`, `getThinkingTokenIds`, the 3
    qwen `getMaskedTokens*`, `getExtraStopTokenIds`, `maskTokenLogits`,
    `isVisibleTextToken`, `isWhitespaceOnlyTextToken`,
    `tokenStartsWithWhitespace`, `decodeForDebug`).
    `smoke-test/real-model-page.js` constructs the WebLLM engine +
    `adoptPreloadedModel` once after [6/8] (covers both causal-LM and
    encoder paths); reused by [7/8], the interactive chat box, and
    bench mode. `smoke-test/real-model-bench.js` accepts engine +
    handleId from caller (no longer creates its own GPU adapter +
    engine). `smoke-test/real-model-runtime.js` drops manual prompt
    tokenization + KV reset; passes the full message array through.
    `tests/real-model-runtime.test.ts` rewritten for the new signature.
  - **Browser smoke verification (this session, single-run on tab
    `52C698CC3FF17A7A9B85EC5CB5EC67E2`, port 50840):** tinyllama
    106.9 tok/s · 64 tokens · finish=max-tokens; qwen3 thinking-off
    83.4 tok/s · 25 tokens · finish=eos; qwen3 thinking-on 17.3 tok/s
    · 236 tokens · finish=eos; embed cosine=0.76 on all three. Output
    text byte-identical across two tinyllama re-runs (seed=12345).
    Console: no errors. `make checkall`: 390 pass / 5 skip / 0 fail
    across 43 files. Committed as `6865a2c`.
- **Profile harness re-baselined** (commit `953c560`). Three latent
  bugs in `eval/perf.ts` had been silently masking every `--profile`
  run since the consolidation: greedy-only trace filter dropped the
  realistic-sampler topk traces; `buildSmokeTestUrl` API drift swallowed
  `?perf=` and `?profile=1`; and `fetchDecodeTraces` couldn't parse
  agentchrome's `output_file` overflow envelope (>16 KB results).
  Fixed all three, added `--thinking` to perf.ts, then captured the
  fresh medians that now drive the "Inference Performance
  Optimizations" preamble.

### Completed on 2026-04-26

1. **§10 wave 1, model 1: smollm2-360m-q4f16 registered + benched.**
   First entry in the large-model size campaign. Smallest registered
   generative model; ultrafast-tier reference point.
   - **Profile registered:** `smollm2-360m-warm` (temperature 0.6,
     `DEFAULT_PROMPT`); added to `SMOKE_PROFILE_SETS.full`.
   - **Repo fix:** the registered `huggingface-quants/SmolLM2-360M-
     Instruct-GGUF` returns HTTP 401 (gated/missing as of 2026-04-26);
     repointed `eval/models.ts` to `bartowski/SmolLM2-360M-Instruct-GGUF`
     and pinned `ggufFilePattern: "Q4_0"` so the picker doesn't fall
     through to Q4_K_M. Q4_0 keeps the cross-family GEMV comparison
     honest against `tinyllama-1.1b-chat-q4_0`.
   - **Architecture (from GGUF metadata):** llama arch · 32 layers ·
     n_head 15 · n_head_kv 5 (GQA 3:1) · embedding_length 960 ·
     head_dim 64 · context_length 8192 (we run at ctx=4096). File
     size 219.1 MB (Q4_0). KV cache at ctx=4096 ≈ 320 MB
     (`2 × 32 × 5 × 64 × 4096 × 4`).
   - **Speed (3-trial median, `eval/perf.ts`):**
     - **Steady-state 106.2 tok/s** (runs: 106.2 / 103.1 / 106.7)
       — within noise of TinyLlama-1.1B Q4_0 (~107 tok/s) despite
       3× fewer params. The speed gap collapse is consistent with
       **encode-overhead dominating at small scale**: SmolLM2's
       32-layer dispatch count (651/token) eclipses TinyLlama's
       22 layers (450/token) and Qwen3-1.7B's 28 layers (629/token).
     - **Profile-mode 75.6 tok/s** (perturbation -29%, identical
       to TinyLlama Q4_0's perturbation factor).
   - **Profile-mode backend attribution (60-step decode):**
     - `backendMatmulMs`: 3.11 mean / 27.9% of graph
     - `backendEncodeOverheadMs`: **3.70 mean / 33.2% of graph
       — leads matmul. First model in the fleet where this is true**
       (TinyLlama: matmul 33% > encode 28%; Qwen3-1.7B: matmul 34% >
       encode 22%). Implication: at this scale dispatch overhead is
       the bigger lever than matmul tuning, which lines up with the
       §6–§9 "matmul kernel tuning has bottomed out" finding from
       the other end of the size axis.
     - `backendAttentionMs`: 0.49 mean / 4.4%
     - `backendDispatchCount`: **651/token** (highest in fleet).
   - **Smoke chat regression:** PASSED. Output: `"Why did the tomato
     turn red? Because it saw the salad dressing!"` — finish=eos,
     21 tokens, no console errors.
   - **Accuracy (`bench-full --profiles smollm2-360m-warm`):**
     **24/36 passing · overall 62%** — lowest accuracy in the fleet,
     expected at 0.36B. Tool-calling skipped (temp 0.6 > 0.4 gate);
     embedding skipped (model lacks the capability). Dashboard runs
     27 / evals 28 (was 26/27 pre-test). Dot landed in
     accuracy×speed scatter.
   - **Behavioural surprises:** none in correctness — chat template,
     tokenizer, KV/attention all clean. The interesting finding is
     architectural: **dispatch count grows faster than parameters
     across the small-model regime** (360M / 32 layers > 1.1B / 22
     layers), which inverts the encode-vs-matmul fraction split.
     Worth re-checking after wave 1's 1.5B+ entries to see whether
     this is a scale crossover or a SmolLM2-specific design choice
     (32 layers at 0.36B implies an unusually deep+narrow shape:
     embedding_length 960 vs Qwen3-0.6B's 1024 at 28 layers).

### Resumption checklist (start a fresh session here)

**Next target: Active Step §10 — large-model test campaign,
wave 1 model 2.** Wave 1 is in progress: `smollm2-360m-q4f16`
landed 2026-04-26 (see "Completed on 2026-04-26 §1"). The next
unprofiled entry by ascending size is **`qwen2.5-1.5b-q4f16`
(1.54B)** — same family as the already-profiled Qwen3-0.6B/1.7B,
useful for a Qwen2 vs Qwen3 architectural-version contrast at
the 1.5B/1.7B scale. Remaining wave-1 fleet after that:
qwen2.5-coder-1.5b, smollm2-1.7b, gemma-2-2b, qwen2.5-3b,
llama-3.2-3b, hermes-3-llama-3.2-3b, phi-3.5-mini, qwen3-4b.
No 7B+ model is registered yet (wave 2).

**Decode tuning is paused at the current scale** — §6/§7/§8/§9
showed the bandwidth-bound fraction is ~40% of matmul on Q8 /
~20% on Q4, ceiling for any further pure-bandwidth lever ~13%
of decode time. Whether that picture holds at 3B–4B scale is the
first thing the campaign needs to answer; the kernel-tuning
levers (subgroup-cooperative loading, FA shape-routing) are
deferred behind that.

Boot sequence:

1. `make checkall` — confirm 391 pass / 5 skip / 0 fail.
2. `git -C ~/Repos/llama.cpp log --oneline -10 webllm-browser-patches`
   — confirm the 10-patch stack is intact (last rebase landed
   2026-04-25).
3. Read the "Inference Performance Optimizations" preamble for
   §6–§9 background and the "Completed on 2026-04-26 §1" entry
   for wave-1 model-1 numbers + the GGUF-mirror lesson, then
   jump to Active Step §10 for the wave plan.
4. Action: register `qwen2.5-1.5b-warm` (temperature 0.6,
   `DEFAULT_PROMPT`) in `eval/smoke-profiles.ts`, add to
   `SMOKE_PROFILE_SETS.full`, then `make smoke-bench
   PERF_MODEL=qwen2.5-1.5b-q4f16 PERF_RUNS=3` followed by
   `bun run eval/bench.ts --profiles qwen2.5-1.5b-warm
   --fail-fast` (with `WEBLLM_LIVE_BENCH_URL` set). Verify the
   `Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct-GGUF` repo isn't gated *before*
   running smoke-bench (smollm2-360m's first registered URL
   was 401 — bartowski mirror fixed it). Watch for: WASM
   memory exhaustion on load, GPU buffer allocation failures,
   KV-cache-size scaling, dispatch-count growth.

Old kernel-tuning targets remain available as **deferred** items:

- **§A — subgroup-cooperative `q_packed` loading** (last
  bandwidth lever; realistic ceiling ~13% decode; was the prior
  §10 entry, now demoted).
- **§B — FA shape-routing for prefill/TTFT** (§5 path a;
  higher-impact for long prompts; FA's main win is seq>1).
- **§C — drafter-based speculative decoding** (large project;
  2-3× wall-clock potential).
- **§D — encoder/embedding perf pass** (untouched since §21).

These deferred targets are below the size campaign in priority,
not abandoned — pick them up after wave 1 lands or if the
campaign hits a blocker (e.g., WASM cap forces a quant rewrite
for 7B+).

Note: the smoke page now does a shader-cache warmup after [6/8]
engine adoption. If you see "1.0 tok/s" on the smoke page after
a fresh WASM rebuild, the warmup didn't run — investigate before
investigating "the engine."

### Historical context (for archive — do not action again)

1. **RESOLVED (2026-04-25): Apr-23 smoke-bench "regression" is a benchmark
   methodology change, not an engine regression.** Bisect (TS bundle only;
   WASM and llama.cpp HEAD constant via `make smoke-test` rebuilds):

   | Commit | Sampler used by smoke page | Decode path | tok/s |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | `0548cd4` (last fast point) | `Sampler({ temperature: 0 })` | `forwardDecode` (4-byte readback) | **118.9** |
   | `d111560` (profiling commit) | greedy | `forwardDecode` | **118.5** |
   | `d131cf0` (KV cap commit) | greedy | `forwardDecode` | **119.6** |
   | `5542bef` (qwen stability) | `makeSmokeSampler` (temp 0.7, topK 40, topP 0.95, repPenalty 1.05) | `forward` (full 32K logits) + JS topK/topP | **56.6** (page-reported) |
   | `main` (HEAD a0d5b9a) | same as 5542bef | `forward` + JS topK/topP | **59.1** |
   | `main` + `?temp=0&rep=1` URL override | greedy override | `forwardDecode` | **116.8** |

   **Root cause**: the new smoke decode loop in `5542bef` (and inherited by
   the page-shell extractions through HEAD) only takes the GPU-reduced
   ARGMAX fast path when `sampler.isGreedy && sampler.noPenalty`
   (`smoke-test/real-model-smoke.js` → `getSmokeSamplingConfig`,
   `smoke-test/real-model-page.js` decode loop). The new realistic sampler
   has `temperature 0.7` and `repetitionPenalty 1.05`, so every step falls
   through to `inference.forward()` — full 32K-vocab logits download plus
   JS-side temperature/topK/topP/penalty work — instead of the 4-byte
   greedy readback the old greedy page used.

   **Engine evidence**: the same `main` build serving the same WASM hits
   116.8 tok/s when the URL forces `temp=0&rep=1`. That matches the 118.9
   tok/s baseline at `0548cd4` to within noise. There is no decode-path
   regression in the inference engine, ggml-webgpu, or async readback.

   **Decision (2026-04-25)**: realistic sampling is the new canonical
   smoke-bench baseline. Do not re-baseline against the historical
   `~115` / `~93.5` greedy-path numbers — they measured a different
   workload and are retired as comparison targets. `forwardDecode` (greedy)
   stays available as the upper-bound diagnostic via `?temp=0&rep=1`, but
   smoke-bench tracks the realistic-sampling number going forward.

   **Re-baseline of item 11 (2026-04-25)**, controlled comparison on HEAD
   with TinyLlama-1.1B Q4_0 (3 trials each, medians shown):

   | Scenario | Decode path | tok/s | ms/token |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | A — greedy + `forwardDecode` (4 B readback) | fast | **114.8** | 8.7 |
   | B — greedy + `forward` (128 KB readback, argmax JS) | mid | **115.9** | 8.7 |
   | C — sampled + `forward` + JS topK/topP/penalty | slow | **52.9** | 19.0 |

   A vs B: ~0.1 ms/token. **Item 11's "negligible" framing still holds**
   even post-async-readback — full 32 K-vocab readback costs essentially
   nothing extra over the 4-byte ARGMAX readback. My earlier hedge was
   wrong; do not block on re-baselining item 11 again.

   B vs C: ~10 ms/token. **The entire 2× slowdown is the JS sampling
   pipeline** (`Sampler.sample()` over 32 K floats: temperature scale +
   topK selection + topP normalization, plus `applyRepetitionPenalty`
   over the recent 64-token window). If decode optimization resumes,
   that is the lever — vectorize / partial-sort / GPU-side topK before
   chasing readback or graph-reuse. The temporary `?slowpath=1` URL
   gate used to capture scenario B is not committed; re-add it from
   git history if you want to re-measure.

   **Fix landed (2026-04-25)**: the GPU TOP_K path already existed in
   `Generator.generate` (`src/inference/generation.ts` 3-way branch
   greedy/topk/full) but the smoke decode loop only branched greedy/full,
   so realistic-sampler steps fell through to full-vocab readback + JS
   topK on 32 K floats. Added a topk middle branch in
   `smoke-test/real-model-smoke.js::createSmokeCompletionRunner` that
   calls `inference.forwardDecode(..., "topk", sampler.topK)` and feeds
   the reduced indices/values into `sampler.sampleFromTopK(...)` (which
   already applies repetition penalty + temperature + topP on the
   k-element set). Gated to skip when qwen masking/thinking state is
   active (`thinkDepth > 0`, `waitingForVisibleAnswer`,
   `hasVisibleAnswerText`) so the GPU's pre-mask top-K choice can't
   leak masked tokens. Measured impact (TinyLlama Q4_0, 3 trials):
   ~53 → ~111 tok/s (2.1×). Qwen3 thinking-off also benefits
   (~76 tok/s with coherent output); thinking-on routes through the
   full path unchanged.

2. **DONE (2026-04-25): library is now the single source of truth for
   decode.** See "Completed on 2026-04-25 (cont.)" above and bug-fix
   entries #23 and #24 for the full landed change set.

---

### Active next steps

1. **DONE (2026-04-25): re-profiled decode against the canonical
   pipeline.** Numbers landed in the "Inference Performance
   Optimizations" preamble above. Three latent harness bugs had been
   hiding the entire profile path since the consolidation; fixed in
   `953c560`. The fresh numbers ratify the same broad direction the
   stale 2026-04-22 profile pointed at — graph compute dominates,
   matmul + encode/dispatch overhead are the leads — but with the
   refinement that **encode overhead leads on Qwen3 (29.2% of graph)
   while matmul leads on TinyLlama (33%)**. The biggest single lever
   is still §2 below: getting qwen3 thinking-on off the full path.

2. **DONE (2026-04-25): qwen3 steering routes through topk + CPU mask
   filter** (commit `3e5be59`). Replaced the full-vocab readback /
   JS sampling pipeline with a `K + STEERING_TOPK_BUFFER` GPU TOP_K
   request followed by CPU-side mask filtering inside
   `Generator.generate`. Decision driven by the diagnostic capture
   on 2026-04-25: masked tokens land in top-K of full-vocab logits
   0.31% of the time, top-(K+10) 0.41% — the masks live deep in
   the tail, so CPU post-filter virtually never exhausts the pool
   and GPU-side WGSL masking would be over-engineering. Measured
   impact: **17.3 → 93.0 tok/s, 5.4×** — much larger than the
   ~24 tok/s prediction because the hot bucket was the JS sampler
   over Qwen3's 152K vocab, not the readback. `waitingForVisibleAnswer`
   stays on the full path because its whitespace-guard resampling
   needs full-vocab access (~2 of 236 captured steps). Output
   coherent on smoke step [8/8]; no regression on TinyLlama or
   Qwen3 thinking-off.

3. **Decode graph reuse** (item 1 in "Inference Performance
   Optimizations" preamble) remains deferred. The 2026-04-21 profile
   measured non-GPU overhead (ctxCreate + buildGraph + backendAlloc +
   teardown) at 1.7% of decode-step time — too small to chase. After
   the throughput uplift and the consolidation, that fraction may
   have grown; re-evaluate as part of §1's profile pass before
   committing to the C-side refactor.

4. **DONE (2026-04-25): characterized qwen3-1.7b-q4f16 through the
   consolidated pipeline.** Numbers landed in the "Inference
   Performance Optimizations" preamble above. Headlines:
   - Steady-state thinking-on **66 tok/s** (clean, 117-token run);
     thinking-off **59 tok/s** but on a 17-token warmup-dominated
     run — trust the thinking-on number for the canonical 1.7B rate.
   - Output coherence verified on the smoke page: clean `<think>` →
     answer transition, finish=eos, embed step still passes
     (cosine=0.76).
   - **Hypothesis confirmed**: dispatch count is architecture-invariant
     within Qwen3 (629/token at both 0.6B and 1.7B). Encode overhead's
     *absolute* cost stays nearly flat (4.07 → 4.20 ms) across 2.83×
     param scale; its *fraction* of graph time *drops* (29.2% →
     22.4%). Matmul scales sub-linearly (4.05 → 6.88 ms, 1.7×) but
     its fraction *grows* (29.1% → 34.2%).
   - **§2's topk fix holds at scale.** 342/348 thinking-on steps
     route through topk; the 6 full-path steps add ~3 ms/step but
     contribute negligibly to wall time.
   - **Quant caveat surfaced**: the `qwen3-*-q4f16` model IDs resolve
     to `Qwen3-*-Q8_0.gguf` (no `ggufFilePattern` pinned, picker
     fallback hits Q8 first). Within-Qwen3 comparisons are clean
     (both Q8); TinyLlama-Q4 vs Qwen3-Q8 absolute matmul ms cross
     two variables — read fractions, not absolute ms, across families.
   - **Bench-full coverage landed (2026-04-25, second session pass)**:
     6 1.7B profiles registered in `eval/smoke-profiles.ts` (3 off +
     3 thinking, mirroring 0.6B layout) and added to `full` /
     `llama-vs-qwen` / `thinking-modes` sets plus a new `qwen3-sizes`
     set. `bench.ts --profiles qwen3-1.7b-*` ran clean: 12/12 phases
     passed, no errors. Dashboard ingested all 6 dots.
     - Per-profile speed (oneShot tok/s, smoke chat regression):
       off-cold 48.3 · off-warm 47.2 · off-hot 45.9 · thinking-cold
       49.8 · thinking-warm 48.2 · thinking-hot 47.8.
     - Per-profile accuracy (overall): off-cold 82% · off-warm 87% ·
       off-hot 88% · thinking-cold 83% · thinking-warm 89% ·
       thinking-hot 87%.
     - Per-dimension headlines: tool-calling 65–71% (cold only;
       skipped at warm/hot per gate), reasoning 92–100% (thinking-
       warm hits 100%), instruction-following 100% across all
       profiles, semantic-reasoning 68–72% (flat; not addressed
       by this size bump).
     - Speed regression note: smoke chat regression numbers
       (45.9–49.8 tok/s) are lower than `perf.ts` steady-state
       (~59–66 tok/s); the gap is the chat-regression harness
       overhead (page-load + interactive run path) not engine
       throughput. Use `perf.ts` for engine claims and dashboard
       for cross-profile accuracy×speed tradeoff.

5. **DONE (2026-04-25, third pass): rebased onto upstream master
   carrying `13d36cf89` (FA browser unblock).** Branch is now 10
   commits on top of upstream (added a row_norm codegen-stability
   split as patch 10 before rebasing — `docs/LLAMA_CPP_PATCHES.md`
   updated with new patch count and rebase note). One conflict on
   `ggml-webgpu.cpp` end-of-`graph_compute` resolved cleanly
   (kept our profiling finalization block; upstream restructured
   nearby `WEBGPU_CPU_PROFILE_TOTAL_END` placement). Backup at
   `webllm-browser-patches-pre-fa-rebase`.

   **No regression:** Qwen3-1.7B steady-state 66.8 tok/s thinking-on
   (was 65.8 pre-rebase — within noise). Profile-mode dispatch count
   **629/token unchanged**, `backendAttentionMs` 0.59ms unchanged,
   matmul/encode within noise. Output coherent on smoke step [7/8]
   ("Why don't scientists trust atoms..."), embed step [8/8] passes.

   **FA didn't engage on these decode shapes.** The new upstream
   `ggml_webgpu_flash_attn_get_decisions` returns the
   subgroup-matrix-required path for our N=1 decode shapes (head_dim
   128, GQA 16/8, K=2048+); browser hits the `supports_op = false`
   branch at line 4460 and falls back to the manual attention path.
   The new VEC and TILE paths target different shapes (longer K, or
   prefill seq>1). To actually engage FA, would need to dig into
   `flash_attn_get_decisions` to understand which shape regions
   route to VEC vs TILE vs subgroup-matrix — see §6 path (a) below.

   **Cold-shader artifact discovered + fixed.** The first decode
   after a WASM rebuild reported 1.0 tok/s on the smoke page — that's
   shader compilation, not a regression. Added a warmup pass in
   `smoke-test/real-model-page.js` after [6/8] engine adoption: runs
   a 2-token `chatCompletion` with realistic sampling (temp 0.6,
   topK 40, repPenalty 1.05) so the topk decode pipeline compiles
   here, not on the first measured call (greedy warmup would only
   compile the greedy/full path). Encoder models warm with
   `embed("warmup")` instead. Verified: cold reload reports
   "[6/8] Shader-cache warmup complete in ~290ms" then
   "[7/8] ... 60.5 tok/s" instead of 1.0 tok/s. Warmup result is
   discarded; KV cache is reset automatically by the next
   `chatCompletion` call. `perf.ts`'s 3-trial median already
   absorbs cold-shader on the first trial, so no harness change
   needed there. The warmup runs on every page load including
   interactive use, not just measurement runs — flag-gating on
   `chatSmoke=` / `bench=` URL params is a follow-up if the ~290ms
   load cost matters.

6. **DONE (2026-04-26): matmul dequant-stub diagnostic — both Q8 and
   Q4 GEMV decode are memory-bound, not compute-bound.** Stubbed out
   the dequant arithmetic in `mul_mat_vec.wgsl::MUL_ACC_Q8_0`
   (`f32(get_byte_i32(q_packed, byte_idx)) * 0.0`) and `MUL_ACC_Q4_0`
   (`(f32(q_byte & 0xFu) - 8.0) * 0.0` / `(f32((q_byte >> 4u) & 0xFu)
   - 8.0) * 0.0`) — preserves the `q_packed` and `d` load chain via
   IEEE-754 `* 0.0 ≠ statically 0` so the optimizer can't DCE the
   reads, just zeroes the contribution to `row_sum`. Rebuilt WASM,
   profiled both quants on the consolidated pipeline against
   immediately-prior baselines:

   | Quant / Model              | Baseline matmul | Stub matmul | Delta  | Dispatch (load survived?) |
   |----------------------------|----------------:|------------:|-------:|---------------------------|
   | Q8_0 / Qwen3-1.7B think-on |        6.67 ms  |    7.04 ms  |  +5.5% | 629 → 629 ✅              |
   | Q4_0 / TinyLlama-1.1B chat |        3.76 ms  |    3.67 ms  |  -2.4% | 450 → 450 ✅              |

   Both deltas are within profile-mode noise (compare ±5% noise on
   raw 3-trial medians); the dispatch-count invariant on both
   quants confirms the load chain wasn't optimizer-eliminated.
   **If the kernel were compute-bound, removing the FMA work should
   drop matmul time substantially (e.g. 30–60%). It barely moved on
   either quant — that's the memory-bound signature.** Stubs reverted
   (`git checkout --` on `mul_mat_vec.wgsl`); WASM rebuilt clean;
   TinyLlama steady-state back to **106.2 tok/s** post-revert.

   **Implication for the next lever:** dequant fusion is *not* the
   right target. The activation vector `src1` (called `x_block` in
   the per-quant inner loops) is loaded by every workgroup from
   global memory; cache it in `var<workgroup>` shared memory and
   load each k-stride exactly once per workgroup. See §7 below for
   the design.

   **FA shape-routing investigation (path a)** remains untouched as
   a separate side-quest — defer unless prefill optimization
   becomes a target.

   **Cleanup item** worth landing whenever next touching `eval/models.ts`:
   pin `ggufFilePattern` on the `qwen3-*-q4f16` entries so the file on
   disk matches the model ID, or rename the IDs to `*-q8` to be honest
   about what the picker fetches.

7. **DONE (2026-04-26): src0-vs-src1 discrimination identified
   src0 (quantized weights) as the dominant bandwidth bottleneck
   on both Q4 and Q8 GEMV decode kernels.** The literal-constant
   form of Stub A (`x_block[i] = 1.0`) tripped a WGSL→SPIR-V
   compiler regression on the first attempt — `backendMatmulMs`
   exploded from 3.87 → 139.62 ms with dispatch count unchanged,
   suggesting register spill of `var<private>` array initialization
   to private memory rather than register allocation. The fix was
   to keep the array fill pattern identical but source `x_block[i]`
   from a single broadcast-load (`let x_const = f32(src1[src1_idx_base])`)
   so the optimizer still sees a real memory dependency and
   register-allocates `x_block` normally. Stub B mirrored that
   approach for src0 (`let d_const = f32(load_f16_at_src0(0u));
   let q_const = load_u32_at_src0(0u);`). With both stubs in
   structurally-equivalent broadcast form, results were:

   | Stub | Quant / Model              | Baseline matmul | Stub matmul | Δ matmul | Δ tok/s | Dispatch |
   |------|----------------------------|----------------:|------------:|---------:|--------:|----------|
   | A    | Q4_0 / TinyLlama-1.1B chat |          3.87 ms |      3.84 ms |    -0.8% |   -3.3% | 450 ✅   |
   | A    | Q8_0 / Qwen3-1.7B          |          6.67 ms |      6.67 ms |     0.0% |    n/a* | 629 ✅   |
   | B    | Q4_0 / TinyLlama-1.1B chat |          3.87 ms |      3.09 ms |  **-20%** | **+5.5%** | 450 ✅   |
   | B    | Q8_0 / Qwen3-1.7B          |          6.67 ms |      3.98 ms |  **-40%** | **+45%**  | 629 ✅   |

   \* Qwen3-1.7B captured under thinking-off in profile mode for
   both Stub A baseline (44.8 tok/s) and Stub B (65.2 tok/s) since
   the matmul kernel is identical regardless of thinking mode.

   **Decision per matrix:** B collapses, A barely moves → re-run
   `OUTPUTS_PER_WG` 4 → 8 (or 16). Bigger tiles amortize each
   weight load across more output rows; this is the matching
   structural lever for src0-bandwidth dominance. Q8 is the
   sweeter target since each block carries 32 q-bytes vs Q4's
   16 q-half-bytes — proportionally more bandwidth per dispatch
   to recover.

   **Stubs reverted** (`git -C ~/Repos/llama.cpp checkout --
   ggml/src/ggml-webgpu/wgsl-shaders/mul_mat_vec.wgsl`); WASM
   rebuilt clean; TinyLlama steady-state ~77.5 tok/s on the
   resulting 2-trial verification (within profile-mode noise of
   pre-stub baseline 81.9). `git -C ~/Repos/llama.cpp status`
   confirms clean working tree.

8. **DONE (2026-04-26): `OUTPUTS_PER_WG` sweep on
   `WEBGPU_MUL_MAT_VEC_LEGACY_Q_OUTPUTS_PER_WG` — OPW=4 is
   locally optimal in [2, 8]. The §7 lever was wrong; the
   reasoning that "bigger tiles amortize weight loads" doesn't
   hold under analysis.** Three-trial medians on the same
   profile harness as §7:

   | OPW  | TinyLlama Q4 tok/s | TinyLlama matmul ms | Qwen3-1.7B Q8 tok/s | Qwen3 matmul ms |
   |-----:|-------------------:|--------------------:|--------------------:|----------------:|
   |   2  |             — *    |               — *   |               34.9  |          8.17   |
   |   4  |             81.9  |               3.87  |               44.8  |          6.67   |
   |   8  |             80.7  |               3.81  |               41.0  |          6.83   |

   \* OPW=2 only profiled on Qwen3-1.7B; the trend was clear
   enough not to spend a TinyLlama run (more workgroups → more
   redundant src1 reads, exactly the inverse of the OPW=8
   regression).

   **Why bigger OPW doesn't help (corrected analysis).** Total
   src0 reads = num_wg × src0_per_wg = (m/OPW) × (OPW × num_blocks ×
   bytes_per_block) = m × num_blocks × bytes_per_block — *invariant
   to OPW*. What bigger OPW *does* reduce is **total src1 reads**
   (each WG reads src1 once and reuses it across OPW output rows;
   total src1 reads scale as m/OPW). Stub A in §7 already
   established that src1 isn't the bandwidth bottleneck, so the
   amortization-of-src1 win bigger OPW provides isn't load-bearing.
   On Q8 specifically, OPW=8 made things *worse* (-8.5% tok/s,
   +2.4% matmul ms) — almost certainly per-thread register
   pressure: the inner loop now keeps `acc: array<f32, 8>` plus
   8 × 8 q-bytes' worth of in-flight FMA state instead of 4 × 8.
   OPW=2 made things much worse (-22% tok/s, +22% matmul ms),
   ruling out "more parallelism for latency hiding" as the lever.

   **What this means for the actual src0 bottleneck.** Stub B in
   §7 measured src0 bandwidth as the dominant cost. Real bandwidth
   savings can only come from:

   - **Smaller-bandwidth quantization** (Q4_K ≈ 4.85 bpw vs Q8_0
     8.5 bpw). A 1.7B Q4_K model would have ~57% of Q8_0's weight
     bandwidth per token. Quality cost needs eval validation —
     dashboard-driven A/B against the existing Qwen3-1.7B Q8 dot
     would be the way.
   - **Subgroup intrinsics for cooperative loading** — threads in
     a subgroup share src0 reads via `subgroupBroadcast` /
     `subgroupShuffle`. Could reduce per-thread src0 reads by
     `subgroup_size`. Requires `enable subgroups;` (already in
     mul_mat_vec.wgsl gated on `USE_SUBGROUP_REDUCTION`) and may
     need shader-architecture changes to expose the right access
     pattern. emdawnwebgpu does support subgroups (just not
     subgroup-matrix); §5 covers the latter.
   - **Inner-loop restructure** for better memory coalescing.
     Current Q8 reads `q_packed` at `block_byte_base + 2u + 4u *
     (thread_within_block * 2u + packed_idx)` — packed_idx
     iterates 0..1 inside the row loop, so consecutive threads in
     the same row issue strided 4-byte loads. Switching to
     `vec4<u32>` reads (load all 4 q_packed at once per block per
     row) might hit the L1/L2 line size more efficiently and is
     a smaller change than subgroup-cooperative loading.

   **OPW reverted to 4** in
   `~/Repos/llama.cpp/ggml/src/ggml-webgpu/ggml-webgpu-shader-lib.hpp:48`.
   `git -C ~/Repos/llama.cpp status` confirms clean working tree.

9. **DONE (2026-04-26): smaller-bandwidth quantization tested via
   `unsloth/Qwen3-1.7B-GGUF` mirror. Q4_0 buys ~12% matmul
   reduction (about 1/3 of Stub B's prediction) for +0.7% tok/s
   (in noise) and 42% smaller download. Q4_K_M is a slight
   regression. Reverted to Q8_0 to keep dashboard baseline
   continuity.** Three-trial profile-mode medians on Qwen3-1.7B
   thinking-off:

   | Quant     | tok/s |  matmul ms | Δ matmul | Δ tok/s | File MB |
   |-----------|------:|-----------:|---------:|--------:|--------:|
   | Q8_0 base |  44.8 |       6.67 |    —     |    —    |    1749 |
   | Q4_K_M    |  43.0 |       6.28 |   -5.8%  |   -4.0% |    1056 |
   | Q4_0      |  45.1 |       5.88 |  -11.8%  |   +0.7% |    1008 |

   **Why Stub B over-predicted.** Stub B replaced *all* src0
   reads with a single broadcast (~1000× bandwidth cut) →
   matmul -40% on Q8 / -20% on Q4. That measures the
   *bandwidth-bound fraction* of matmul kernel time: ~40% on Q8,
   ~20% on Q4. Switching Q8 → Q4_0 only halves bandwidth, so the
   modeled win is 50% × 40% = 20% matmul drop, observed 11.8%
   (~60% of model). The gap is attributable to Q4_0's slightly
   different inner-loop arithmetic (Q4 unpacks two 4-bit nibbles
   per byte vs Q8's single byte), modest cache-pattern shifts,
   and run-to-run variance.

   **Q4_K_M's poor result** is consistent with K-quants being
   compute-heavier per element: 8 sub-blocks per 256-element
   super-block, multiple scales/mins per super-block, more
   metadata reads. The bandwidth savings (Q8 1.06 bpw → Q4_K_M
   0.56 bpw, same as Q4_0) get clawed back by more inner-loop
   arithmetic and metadata fetches. Q4_K is a quality/bandwidth
   trade-off, not a quality/throughput one.

   **Net for the §7 lever investigation:** matmul on Qwen3-1.7B
   is ~33% of decode time, of which ~40% is bandwidth-bound. So
   the *theoretical max* speedup from any pure-bandwidth lever
   is ~13% of decode time. Bigger structural wins (prefill,
   speculative decoding, drafter models) live elsewhere.

   **Side fixes landed:**
   - `src/models/gguf-parser.ts::ggmlTypeSize` was missing Q8_0,
     Q4_K and all K-quants — they fell to `?? 4` which
     over-estimates `totalDataSize` by ~7×. With `no_alloc:true`
     in `ctx_create` (`src/wasm/webgpu-bridge.cpp`), this hadn't
     been load-bearing for Q8_0 in practice, but Q4_K_M would
     have requested a ~6 GB ggml ctx buffer (above 4 GB WASM
     cap) without the fix. Table now covers F32, F16, Q4_0–Q8_K
     legacy + K-quants, I32, BF16.
   - `eval/models.ts` Qwen3-1.7B entry has a maintenance comment
     describing how to swap to unsloth's mirror + ggufFilePattern
     to re-run the quant experiment.

10. **IN PROGRESS (wave 1 underway): large-model test campaign.**
    The current smoke fleet tops out at Qwen3-1.7B. Decode-kernel
    tuning has bottomed out at this scale (§6–§9). The active
    priority is now **scaling the model fleet** — exercise the
    registered-but-unprofiled 3B–4B models, then register and
    test 7B+ candidates with small quants. Whether the
    bandwidth-bound matmul picture from §6–§9 holds at 3B+
    scale is the first question this campaign answers; that
    informs whether the deferred kernel-tuning levers (§A
    subgroup-cooperative loading, §B FA shape-routing) become
    worth chasing again.

    **Wave 1: registered-but-untested models (lowest risk; same
    kernel paths; just need profile registration).** Order by
    increasing size. Each entry is already in `eval/models.ts`;
    none has a smoke profile in `eval/smoke-profiles.ts`.
    - [x] `smollm2-360m-q4f16` (0.36B) — DONE 2026-04-26.
      Steady-state 106 tok/s Q4_0 / profile-mode 75.6 / 651
      dispatches/token / 24/36 accuracy. Encode overhead leads
      matmul. See "Completed on 2026-04-26 §1" above for full
      numbers + the bartowski-mirror repo fix.
    - `qwen2.5-1.5b-q4f16` (1.54B) — Qwen2.5 1.5B for a
      family/version comparison vs Qwen3-1.7B already profiled.
    - `qwen2.5-coder-1.5b-q4f16` (1.54B) — code-tuned variant;
      mostly interesting if we add a code-generation eval task.
    - `smollm2-1.7b-q4f16` (1.71B) — same size as Qwen3-1.7B,
      different family.
    - `gemma-2-2b-q4f16` (2.61B) — first Gemma family member;
      different RoPE / norm conventions worth verifying.
    - `qwen2.5-3b-q4f16` (3.09B) — first 3B-class entry.
    - `llama-3.2-3b-q4f16` (3.21B) — Llama family at 3B.
    - `hermes-3-llama-3.2-3b-q4f16` (3.21B) — Hermes fine-tune
      of Llama 3.2 3B; useful for tool-calling eval contrast.
    - `phi-3.5-mini-q4f16` (3.82B) — Phi family (different
      architecture than Llama/Qwen).
    - `qwen3-4b-q4f16` (4.0B) — **largest registered**; the
      stress test for current WASM/GPU memory budget at Q4.

    **Wave 2: register 7B+ candidates with small quants if the
    WASM 4 GB cap allows.** Q4_0 7B = ~3.94 GB just for weights —
    sits right at the WASM cap; will probably need Q3_K_M (~3.0 GB)
    or smaller. Candidates to register:
    - Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (or Llama-3.2-equivalent)
    - Qwen3-7B / Qwen3-8B
    - Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3
    - Gemma-2-9B (probably won't fit)

    **Per-model action sequence:**
    1. Register a smoke profile in `eval/smoke-profiles.ts` —
       at minimum a `<id>-warm` (temperature 0.6, prompt
       `DEFAULT_PROMPT`); for Qwen3 family also add `-thinking-warm`.
       Add the new name to `SMOKE_PROFILE_SETS.full` (and the
       relevant family set, e.g., `qwen3-sizes` for qwen3-4b).
    2. `make smoke-bench PERF_MODEL=<id> PERF_RUNS=3` — captures
       tok/s, prefill/decode ms, matmul ms, dispatch count.
       Watch for: download success, model loads, [7/8] coherent
       output, no console errors.
    3. `make bench-full --profiles <profile-name>` — lands the
       accuracy×speed dot in the dashboard.
    4. Update this TODO with measured numbers (tok/s, matmul ms,
       dispatch count, dashboard accuracy summary, anything
       surprising).

    **Failure modes to watch for at scale:**
    - **WASM memory exhaustion at load.** ggml ctx_create + tensor
      uploads + KV cache must fit in the 4 GB WASM cap. Q4 4B
      models are ~2.25 GB weights + KV; should fit.  7B Q3_K may
      not. If `_ctx_create` fails or `RangeError: Memory size out
      of bounds`, drop to a smaller quant or investigate
      `MAXIMUM_MEMORY` bump.
    - **GPU buffer allocation failures.** Browsers vary on
      `maxBufferSize` / `maxStorageBufferBindingSize`. Look for
      `Buffer creation failed` in the WebGPU console.
    - **KV cache scaling.** Default `contextLength` in
      `eval/models.ts` is 4096 for most entries. KV cache size =
      `2 × n_layer × n_head × head_dim × seq × 4 bytes`. For
      Llama 3.2-3B at 4K context that's ~128 MB; for an 8B at
      4K it's ~512 MB. Could be the second hardest constraint
      after weights.
    - **Dispatch count growth.** TinyLlama (22 layers) emits 450
      dispatches/token; Qwen3-1.7B (28 layers) 629/token. A 4B
      model with ~36 layers would hit ~810/token; 7B (~32 layers
      typical) ~720/token. Encode-overhead-per-step scales
      linearly with dispatch count.
    - **Matmul `m` dimension scaling.** Most matmuls have
      `m = hidden_size`. Going from 1.7B (hidden 2048) to 4B
      (hidden 2560) to 7B (hidden 4096) increases per-matmul
      bandwidth roughly proportionally. The §6–§9
      bandwidth-bound characterization may or may not hold —
      part of the campaign value is finding out.

    **Output format for each measurement:** add a numbered entry
    under "### Completed on YYYY-MM-DD" with the model id,
    profile name, observed tok/s (steady-state and profile-mode),
    matmul ms / fraction, dispatch count, KV cache size at the
    test prompt length, smoke output verdict, and any
    behavioural surprises (e.g., chat template quirks, BOS
    handling, tool-call format edge cases).

    **Stop conditions / when to pivot back to deferred §A–§D:**
    - All wave 1 models land cleanly with no engine regressions
      and decode behaviour matches §6–§9 predictions → §A
      subgroup loading becomes worth attempting.
    - WASM cap forces a build change (e.g., MAXIMUM_MEMORY
      bump to 8 GB, JSPI investigation §12) → that becomes the
      blocker, address it before continuing the campaign.
    - A model exposes a correctness bug (template, tokenizer,
      arch) → fix in `src/models/` and add a regression test
      before resuming the campaign.

### Deferred kernel-tuning targets (behind §10 in priority)

§A. **Subgroup-cooperative `q_packed` loading in
    `mul_mat_vec.wgsl::MUL_ACC_Q8_0` / `MUL_ACC_Q4_0`.** The
    remaining Stub B remediation (was the prior §10 "NEXT"
    before the size pivot). Threads in a subgroup share their
    loaded `q_packed` values via `subgroupBroadcast` so each
    thread issues fewer src0 reads. Realistic ceiling: ~13% of
    decode time at the current scale (matmul × bandwidth-bound
    fraction). May change with larger models — re-evaluate after
    wave 1 of §10. Risk: the current per-thread access uses
    `thread_within_block` to address q_packed, which already
    partitions src0 across threads — further sharing across
    subgroup boundaries (vs the current within-workgroup
    partitioning) may not buy anything.

    Lower-cost alternative: vec4-packed loads (read 4
    consecutive `q_packed` u32s in one instruction). Smaller
    engineering cost, smaller predicted win.

§B. **FA shape-routing for prefill/TTFT** (§5 path a). Decode
    shape (N=1, head_dim 128, GQA 16:8) doesn't engage FA
    post-rebase. Higher-impact for prefill latency / longer
    prompts; FA's main win is seq>1. Probe
    `flash_attn_get_decisions` for the VEC vs TILE vs
    subgroup-matrix shape regions and adjust the guard. Becomes
    more attractive once larger models (longer K dimension at
    the same context length) land in §10.

§C. **Drafter-based speculative decoding.** Larger project,
    well-trodden territory in the literature. Potential 2–3×
    wall-clock decode for chat-style workloads where the
    drafter is mostly right. Drafter could be one of the §10
    wave 1 small models (smollm2-360m or qwen3-0.6b) paired
    with a 3B+ target.

§D. **Encoder/embedding perf pass.** §21 dashboard section
    shipped but the encoder forward pass hasn't had a perf
    pass. Quick win possible if anyone uses arctic-embed-s/m
    at throughput.

11. The latent 3+ binding buffer-conflict edge case in
    `ggml_backend_webgpu_build_multi` (item 3 in preamble) remains
    untested — no llama op hits it today.

12. **JSPI feasibility checkpoint** remains a follow-up investigation,
   not the next implementation step.
   - **Go/no-go:** no-go for the current milestone; the
     completion-driven readback path is the active baseline.
   - **What would have to change if revisited:** flip the WASM build
     from the current ASYNCIFY setup toward JSPI-related flags in
     `src/wasm/CMakeLists.txt`, replace
     `ggml-wasm.ts::callWithAsyncify()` with direct JSPI-compatible
     async export handling, re-audit Emscripten runtime exports to
     remove Asyncify-specific methods and keep only the JSPI-needed
     surface, assess whether the local `~/Repos/llama.cpp` branch's
     `ggml-webgpu: browser + ASYNCIFY support bundle` needs a
     parallel JSPI patch path, and verify browser support/behavior
     on the actual target matrix before any migration.

1. `ggml: iterative ggml_visit_parents_graph for WASM stack safety`
2. `ggml-webgpu: browser + ASYNCIFY support bundle`
3. `ggml-webgpu: request-based browser readback API`
