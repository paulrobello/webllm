# WebLLM Project Status & Roadmap

> **Date:** 2026-04-27
> **Status:** End-to-end browser inference is working for both causal LMs and
> BERT-style encoders (Arctic-Embed). `make bench-full` now drives the
> generative profiles plus the embedding profiles end-to-end into the live
> SQLite-backed dashboard. The dashboard has a dedicated Embeddings section
> (cosine, latency, throughput) and the per-dimension / temperature-sweep /
> Accuracy×Speed charts split Qwen thinking-on vs thinking-off into
> distinct series. The eval suite separates chat-style semantic reasoning
> from true embedding-vector tasks. **The library is now the single source
> of truth for decode**: `engine.chatCompletion` drives [7/8], the
> interactive chat box, and bench mode through the same `Generator.generate`
> that public consumers hit. The parallel decode loop in
> `createSmokeCompletionRunner` is gone. Decode-mode selection is now
> per-step (greedy / topk / full) so steps without active steering state
> stay on the topk fast path even when the config configures steering.
> **Current canonical baselines (post-§32, `bun run eval/perf.ts
> --runs 3` non-profile, captured 2026-04-27/28).** The canonical 6
> are the ship-gate fleet for every rebase + sweep cycle (§27 / §32
> templates):
> - tinyllama-1.1b-chat-q4_0 (Q4_0): **110.8 tok/s decode**
> - qwen3-0.6b-q4f16 (actual: Q8_0): **89.8 tok/s decode**
>   (was ~17 — see `3e5be59`: CPU post-filter top-K replaced the
>   full-vocab readback + JS sampling pipeline that was costing
>   ~76 tok/s on Qwen3's 152K vocab)
> - qwen3-1.7b-q4f16 (actual: Q8_0): **62.2 tok/s decode**
>   (warmup-dominated at 17 tokens; longer 117-token runs land
>   higher steady-state)
> - mistral-7b-instruct-v0.3-q4ks (Q4_K_S): **35.0 tok/s decode**
>   (5-run median; first-run wall-time outlier excluded)
> - llama-3.1-8b-instruct-iq3m (IQ3_M): **27.2 tok/s decode**
>   (5-run median; -6.2% vs §27 baseline 29.0, accepted as final
>   per §32 — H1 "tied-embedding × #22456 aliasing" rejected at §32a)
> - qwen3-8b-iq3m (IQ3_M): **27.2 tok/s decode** (post-§27, +80% on
>   §16's pre-rebase 16.2 from upstream's #22344 fast i-quant
>   mat-vec kernels)
>
> Smaller-fleet pins (wave-1 / arch-survey, 2026-04-26):
> - smollm2-360m-q4f16 (Q4_0): ~106 tok/s decode (within noise of
>   TinyLlama at the same quant despite 3× fewer params — encode
>   overhead dominates at this scale; see §10 wave-1 entry)
> - qwen3-4b-q4f16 (Q4_0): 35.5 tok/s, **highest accuracy in
>   fleet** at 88-90% (§10 wave-1)
>
> Profile-mode pins for the canonical 6 (3-run median, perturbed
> -15 to -28% vs non-profile due to per-dispatch timestamp
> sampling — see `eval/reports/pre-rebase-baselines-2026-04-28/
> SUMMARY.md`): 87.9 / 68.2 / 44.0 / 29.7 / 23.5 / 21.8 tok/s.
>
> Bench-full coverage at 1.7B landed (6 profiles · 3 off + 3 thinking)
> with overall accuracy 82–89% and per-profile decode (smoke chat
> regression, oneShot tok/s) 45.9–49.8. Smoke-regression numbers
> are lower than `perf.ts` steady-state due to harness overhead;
> compare against `perf.ts` for engine-throughput claims. Dashboard
> on port 8033 has all 6 dots in the accuracy×speed scatter.
>
> llama.cpp `webllm-browser-patches` rebased onto upstream master
> 2026-04-25 (carries `13d36cf89` FA browser unblock + `dd2914dc8`
> SSM_SCAN/set_rows changes). 10 patches now (added a row_norm
> codegen-stability split). No engine regression; FA path doesn't
> engage on Qwen3-1.7B decode shapes — see Active Step §5 for the
> diagnosis. Smoke page now runs a shader-cache warmup after [6/8]
> engine adoption to keep speed measurements steady-state across
> WASM rebuilds.

> Decode hotspot diagnostic landed 2026-04-26 (Active Step §6):
> matmul dequant-stub on both Q8 (Qwen3-1.7B) and Q4 (TinyLlama)
> moved `backendMatmulMs` by less than ±5.5% / ±2.5% with dispatch
> count unchanged — both kernels are **memory-bound, not

> Step §7) ran 2026-04-26: **src0 (weights) dominates**, src1
> (activations) is already L2-cached fine. Stub A moved matmul
> -0.8% Q4 / 0.0% Q8; Stub B moved matmul **-20% Q4 / -40% Q8**
> with decode +5.5% / +45%. `OUTPUTS_PER_WG` sweep (§8) confirmed
> OPW=4 locally optimal — bigger OPW only reduces src1 reads

> on Qwen3-1.7B: Q4_0 -11.8% matmul / +0.7% tok/s (in noise),
> Q4_K_M -5.8% matmul / -4% tok/s (regression — K-quant compute

>
> **Pivot 2026-04-26: scope expansion to larger models.** Decode

> Cross-family speed/accuracy pattern is now confirmed across

## Project Constraints

The five workflow policies that gate every change on this project —
**30B model-size ceiling**, **quick-wins override on YAGNI**,
**probe-first default**, **complexity ≠ implementation time**, and
**always commit before work** — moved to
[`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md#workflow-policies-set-2026-04-28) on 2026-04-28
so they apply to all sessions, not just ones that load TODO.md. Read
that section before starting any new work; entries below cite the
policies (e.g. "deferred under the 30B ceiling") without re-stating
them.

## Cumulative Bug Fix History

The full bug-fix history (28 entries through 2026-04-26) lives in
`TODO_ARCHIVE.md`. Recent fixes (2026-04-27 onward) are documented
inline in their cycle's "Completed on" entry below.


## Debug Tools

`src/inference/model-inference.ts` has instrumented debug helpers. From the browser console on `smoke-test/real-model.html`:

```js
await window.inference.debugReadEmbeddingRow(1);  // BOS

window.inference.resetKVCache();
await window.inference.forward(new Int32Array([22172]), new Int32Array([0]));
await window.inference.debugReadKCache(0, 64*4, 0);
await window.inference.debugReadVCache(0, 64*4, 0);

await window.inference.debugReadNormWeight("attn0", 8);

await window.inference.debugLayerOutput(
  22172, 0, "layer_output"
  // or: "pre_attn" | "attn_normed" | "attn_q" | "attn_k" | "attn_v"
  //     | "attn_out" | "post_attn" | "ffn_normed" | "ffn_gate" | "ffn_up"
  //     | "ffn_hidden" | "ffn_out"
);
```

`smoke-test/real-model.html` stashes `window.{inference, tokenizer, parsedModel}` for console use.

# Inference Performance Optimizations

Baseline (pre-optimization): ~44 tok/s decode, ~130 ms prefill on TinyLlama 1.1B
Q4_0 via Emscripten WebGPU in-browser.

**Steady-state decode baselines (2026-04-25, non-profile, realistic
sampler):** TinyLlama Q4_0 ~107 tok/s · Qwen3 0.6B thinking-off ~83
tok/s · Qwen3 0.6B thinking-on ~17 tok/s · Qwen3 1.7B thinking-on
~66 tok/s · (Qwen3 1.7B thinking-off measured at ~59 tok/s but on a
17-token run that's warmup-dominated; the thinking-on number is the
clean steady-state at this size). These are the canonical numbers to
compare new perf work against.

**Quant caveat:** model IDs `qwen3-*-q4f16` actually resolve to
`Qwen3-*-Q8_0.gguf` files (610 MB at 0.6B, 1.7 GB at 1.7B) because no
`ggufFilePattern` is pinned and the picker fallback hits Q8 first. So
within-Qwen3 comparisons across sizes are clean (both Q8), but
TinyLlama-Q4 vs Qwen3-Q8 absolute matmul ms cross two variables —
read matmul *fraction of graph time* across families, not absolute ms.
Cleanup item: pin `ggufFilePattern: "Q4_K"` (or similar) on the qwen3
entries in `eval/models.ts` if Q4 comparisons become load-bearing.

**Profile-mode hotspot ranking (2026-04-25, `--profile`).** Captured
through `make smoke-bench PERF_RUNS=3` after fixing three latent
harness bugs (`953c560`) that had been masking trace collection since
the consolidation landed. `--profile` enables ggml-webgpu's detailed
backend timing and perturbs throughput measurably:

| Profile          | Steady-state | Profile-mode | Perturbation |
|------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| TinyLlama Q4_0   | ~107 tok/s   | 76 tok/s     | -29%         |
| Qwen3-0.6 off    | ~83 tok/s    | 55 tok/s     | -34%         |
| Qwen3-0.6 on     | ~17 tok/s    | 14.6 tok/s   | -14%         |
| Qwen3-1.7 off    | ~59 tok/s*   | 41.5 tok/s   | -29%         |
| Qwen3-1.7 on     | ~66 tok/s    | 43.2 tok/s   | -34%         |

\* warmup-dominated 17-token run; trust the thinking-on number for the
clean 1.7B steady-state.

Cite steady-state numbers for throughput claims; cite profile-mode
ratios for hotspot ranking. Mixing the two is what derailed the
"Apr-23 regression" investigation.

Per-step decode breakdown by mode (medians from the runs above):

Headlines:
- **Decode is graph-compute-bound across every profile** (~89–95% of
  step time). Readback is a 4–9% slice; further async-readback work
  has tiny headroom.
- **Dispatch count is architecture-invariant within Qwen3** (629/token
  for both 0.6B and 1.7B topk paths). The earlier "graph-shape reduction
  has more leverage on Qwen3" framing was right about the dispatch
  delta vs TinyLlama (629 vs 450); what we now know is that *encode
  overhead's absolute cost is ~flat* (4.07 → 4.20 ms across the 2.83×
  param jump). Its *fraction* of graph time drops with model size
  (29.2% → 22.4%) — i.e. the encode lever has *diminishing*
  trajectory at scale.
- **Matmul scales sub-linearly with parameter count** within Qwen3:
  4.05 → 6.88 ms (1.7×) for 2.83× params, consistent with bandwidth-
  bound GEMV on Q8 weights. Matmul share grows from 29.1% → 34.2%, so
  matmul kernel work has *growing* trajectory at scale and is now the
  clear lead bucket on Qwen3-1.7B (33–34%) by ~12pp over encode.
- **§2's topk fix holds at scale.** Thinking-on at 1.7B routes 342/348
  steps (98%) through topk; the remaining 6 full-path steps add ~3 ms/
  step but contribute negligibly to wall time. Cost-per-token is at
  near-parity with thinking-off at this size.
- **Decision criteria don't cleanly hit the >40% / >25% / ~30%
  thresholds** in TODO §4. Matmul 33–34% is below the >40% rule;
  encode 20–22% is below the >25% rule; "balanced ~30%" is closest
  but matmul leads by a margin. The recommendation below is a
  trajectory call (encode flat-absolute, matmul still scaling), not
  a threshold match.
- **Consolidation tightened TinyLlama dispatches and matmul share**
  vs the stale 2026-04-22 numbers (489 → 450 dispatches/token, matmul
  share 40.4% → 33.0%). Treat that as a quiet consolidation win, not
  a headline.

Items in rough order of expected impact. Each entry explains the idea, where
the code lives today, the expected win, and the risk/tradeoff.

---

## High impact

### 1. Decode graph reuse (deferred)
- **Where**: `src/inference/model-inference.ts::forward()`
- **Today**: every call to `forward()` calls `ctxCreate`, builds the full
  ~440-op graph, calls `backendAllocCtxTensors`, uploads leaf inputs, runs
  compute, then `ctxFree`s. For a decode step with `nTokens=1` the graph
  shape is identical across steps.
- **Change**: cache the graph for `nTokens=1` decode. Only update:
  - leaf inputs (`posTensor`, `tokenIdsTensor`, mask row for current position)
  - the K/V cache offsets (encoded into the graph nodes via `pastLen * kNb1`
    constants, so this needs either graph reuse with runtime offset or
    rebuilding just the KV views each step)
- **Expected**: 2–5× decode throughput. The JS-side graph construction +
  WASM asyncify round trip is currently a meaningful chunk of per-step cost.
- **Risk**: the ggml graph stores absolute offsets inside view tensors.
  Reusing the graph requires either:
  - Adding a C-side helper that mutates view tensor offsets in place, or
  - Refactoring KV cache layout so writes always go to a fixed slot and the
    "real" position is a permutation applied separately, or
  - Pre-building graphs for every possible past-length (memory hungry)
- **Profile measurement (2026-04-21):**
  - mean total per decode step: 16.75 ms
  - ctxCreate: 0.00 ms (0.0%)
  - buildGraph: 0.21 ms (1.3%)
  - backendAlloc: 0.05 ms (0.3%)
  - uploadLeaves: 0.02 ms (0.1%)
  - graphCompute: 6.92 ms (41.3%)
  - downloadLogits: 9.53 ms (56.9%)
  - teardown: 0.02 ms (0.1%)
  - Non-GPU overhead (ctxCreate + buildGraph + backendAlloc + teardown) = 1.7%.
- **Status**: deferred. Big structural change relative to its current
  expected win at 17.5 ms/step. Revisit if we can measure that graph
  building (not GPU compute) is actually the bottleneck.
- **Phase A skipped:** GPU compute + logits download dominate; moving graph
  build to C can at best claw back ~1.7% and isn't worth the C-side
  maintenance burden.

### 2. Re-enable batched compute passes in the WebGPU backend ✅ DONE
- **Where**: `~/Repos/llama.cpp/ggml/src/ggml-webgpu/ggml-webgpu.cpp`
- **Fix**: flipped `batch_compute_passes` to `true`. Safe now that
  overlap-only conflict detection (item 3) doesn't schedule inter-dispatch
  CopyBufferToBuffer calls for most ops.
- **Actual gain**: marginal on top of item 3 (most of the 33% came from
  item 3). Still worth keeping for larger models where driver overhead
  of many compute passes would dominate.

### 3. Refine buffer-conflict detection (overlap-only) ✅ DONE
- **Where**: `~/Repos/llama.cpp/ggml/src/ggml-webgpu/ggml-webgpu.cpp`
  `__EMSCRIPTEN__` block in `ggml_backend_webgpu_build_multi`.
- **Was**: created a temp GPU buffer for EVERY same-buffer-different-offset
  binding pair, even when the ranges didn't actually overlap. WebGPU's
  validation only rejects overlapping ranges, not disjoint ones.
- **Fix**: added an `overlap` check (`!(a_end <= b_start || b_end <= a_start)`)
  before creating a temp buffer. Most attention/FFN op bindings turned out
  to be disjoint slices of the shared graph buffer.
- **Actual gain**: **+28% decode throughput** (44 → 56 tok/s). The bulk of
  the original overhead was unnecessary `CopyBufferToBuffer` calls.

---

## Medium impact

### 4. Enable flash attention in the browser 🟡 UPSTREAM UNBLOCKED 2026-04-25
- **Where**: `ggml-webgpu.cpp::ggml_backend_webgpu_device_supports_op`
  under `GGML_OP_FLASH_ATTN_EXT` — currently `#ifndef __EMSCRIPTEN__`
  on our patch branch (rebase point `68f1738d5`).
- **Was blocked on**: emdawnwebgpu does NOT expose
  `wgpu::FeatureName::ChromiumExperimentalSubgroupMatrix`; llama.cpp's
  original FA shaders required subgroup-matrix.
- **Unblock**: upstream commit `13d36cf89` ("ggml-webgpu: enable
  FLASH_ATTN_EXT on browser without subgroup matrix", #22199, merged
  2026-04-24) adds a tile / vec FA fallback that does NOT require
  subgroup-matrix. Path forward is now a rebase, not waiting on
  Chrome.
- **Expected gain (decode):** modest. Decode-mode attention is N=1,
  so the [seq, seq] matrix that FA avoids materializing is tiny. The
  per-token win comes from fewer dispatches (likely 3–5 fewer per
  layer, ~100/token on Qwen3) reducing encode overhead by ~0.5–1 ms,
  plus a small `backendAttentionMs` saving. Realistic ceiling at
  decode: 3–5%. Not a 10% lever on its own.
- **Expected gain (prefill):** substantial. FA's main win is for
  long-prompt prefill where attention matrix size scales with seq².
  If prefill latency / TTFT becomes a target, this is the lever.
- **Action**: rebase the patch branch to a point at-or-after
  `13d36cf89`, drop the `#ifndef __EMSCRIPTEN__` guard, re-verify
  smoke + perf, capture the dispatch-count delta on Qwen3-1.7B as
  the headline measurement. Rebase carries non-trivial maintenance
  cost (~9 patches; see `docs/LLAMA_CPP_PATCHES.md`).

### 5. Fused SwiGLU op ✅ DONE
- **Where**: `src/inference/model-inference.ts` FFN section.
- **Actual gain**: +1–2% (58 → ~58.5 tok/s). Modest — FFN compute is
  dominated by the three mul_mats, not by silu/mul. Kept for cleanliness.

### 6. F16 KV cache ❌ NET LOSS AT SHORT CONTEXT
- **Tried**: switched K and V to `F16`. WebGPU backend handled F16×F32
  mul_mat correctly — no correctness regression.
- **Measured**: **-7.7%** decode throughput (55.3 tok/s vs 59.9 baseline).
  F16×F32 mul_mat not as fast as F32×F32 for small matrices, and F32→F16
  conversion on every KV write adds dispatch overhead at short contexts.
- **Reverted**: code stays F32. Reconsider for long-context workloads
  (1000+ tokens) where bandwidth savings on attention reads will overtake
  write-path overhead.

---

## Low impact / polish

### 7. Skip redundant `opCont` calls ✅ DONE
- **Where**: K/V cache writes in `forward()`.
- **Actual gain**: +0–2% on top of item 5. Still worth keeping: fewer
  dispatches, cleaner code.

### 8. Skip mask tensor for nTokens=1 decode ✅ DONE (partial)
- **Where**: `forward()` mask allocation + upload + softmax_ext call.
- **Actual gain**: flat. Still a cleanup. Pre-allocating mask at
  `initKVCache` time deferred.

### 9. Reduce JS↔WASM boundary crossings ✅ DONE
- **Where**: `src/wasm/webgpu-bridge.cpp` + `src/inference/ggml-wasm.ts`
  + `forward()` in `model-inference.ts`.
- **Change**: added `backend_tensor_set3` in C bridge — single bundled WASM
  call for pos + ids + mask instead of 2–3 separate hops.
- **Actual gain**: **+5–7% decode throughput** (55.6 → 58.7 tok/s median).

### 10. Benchmark the current pipeline ✅ DONE
- **Where**: `eval/perf.ts` + `make smoke-bench` + `make bench-inference-save`.
- **Current Task 5 profiled investigation baseline**: 93.5 tok/s on the
  profiled TinyLlama-1.1B Q4_0 browser run (`PERF_RUNS=3`), with median-run
  wall time 2027 ms, `graphComputeMs` mean 9.96 ms, and `downloadResultMs`
  mean 0.62 ms. Read this as a profiling baseline for hotspot ranking, not as
  the new steady-state browser throughput baseline.
- `make smoke-bench` — end-to-end: builds WASM+JS, starts server, launches
  agentchrome (headed), runs 3 perf iterations with `--profile`, cleans up.
  All smoke targets (`smoke-serve`, `smoke-open`, `smoke-run`, `smoke-bench`)
  depend on `smoke-test` for fresh builds.

### 11. GPU-side ARGMAX/TOP_K logits reduction ✅ DONE (negligible gain)
- **Where**: `src/wasm/webgpu-bridge.cpp` (C bridge), `src/inference/ggml-wasm.ts`
  (TS bindings), `src/inference/model-inference.ts::forwardDecode()`,
  `src/inference/generation.ts` (decode loop routing),
  `src/inference/sampler.ts::sampleFromTopK()`,
  `src/core/engine.ts` (wiring), `smoke-test/real-model.html` (both code paths).
- **What**: Added `ggml_argmax` and `ggml_top_k` to the WASM bridge. New
  `forwardDecode()` method builds the same transformer graph but appends
  ARGMAX/TOP_K tail ops, downloading 4 bytes (greedy) or k×8 bytes (topk)
  instead of 128KB (32K×float32) full logits. Generation loop auto-selects
  mode: greedy (temp=0, no penalty), topk (topK>0), or full (fallback).
  Smoke test step 7 and chat handler both use the greedy path.
- **Actual gain**: **+0.5%** (58.7 → 59.0 tok/s). Negligible.
- **Why**: The readback bottleneck is synchronization latency, not data size.
  At the time of measurement, `downloadFromTensor()` still paid queue/map wait
  latency that dominated the ~9.5ms readback regardless of whether the payload
  was 4 bytes or 128KB. Reducing data size only saved the final memcpy
  (~0.01ms for 128KB).
- **Follow-up completed**: the browser stack now has a real request-based async
  readback path:
  - `~/Repos/llama.cpp/ggml/include/ggml-webgpu.h`
  - `~/Repos/llama.cpp/ggml/src/ggml-webgpu/ggml-webgpu.cpp`
  - `src/wasm/webgpu-bridge.cpp`
  - `src/inference/ggml-wasm.ts::downloadFromTensor()`
  This adds backend `begin / poll / finish / cancel` support, wires it through
  the WASM bridge, and uses heap allocation safely across async boundaries.
- **Current status**: correctness/integration is fixed, browser smoke passes,
  and the latest profiled run shows the completion-driven path has reduced
  `downloadResultMs` to a 0.64 ms mean. Readback is now a smaller slice of
  decode latency than the rest of the step.
- **Infrastructure value**: The ARGMAX/TOP_K bridge functions, `forwardDecode()`,
  generation-loop routing, and the new async readback request API are all useful
  foundations for the next round of latency-hiding work. The
  `sampleFromTopK()` sampler method enables CPU sampling on GPU-reduced
  candidate sets for temperature > 0.

## Dashboard & Visualization

Live bench dashboard at `smoke-test/dashboard.*` (served by
`eval/live-server.ts` on port 8033). Each section below is independently
shippable on top of the existing eval/run data — no new bench metadata
needs to be collected.

### 12. Convert existing charts to a proper charting library ✅ DONE
- **Where**: `smoke-test/dashboard.js`, `smoke-test/dashboard.html`,
  `smoke-test/dashboard.css`, `smoke-test/vendor/chart.umd.min.js`.
- **Done**: introduced self-hosted Chart.js 4 UMD and converted the main
  dashboard charts to managed Chart.js instances with dark-theme colors,
  legends, tooltips, and dynamic chart-host sizing.
- **Follow-up**: use `make vendor-refresh` after bumping `chart.js` to refresh
  the vendored browser bundle.

### 13. Accuracy × Speed scatter chart ✅ DONE
- **Where**: `smoke-test/dashboard.js::renderScatterChart`,
  `smoke-test/dashboard.html`.
- **What**: one dot per profile. X = mean tok/s, Y = eval `overall`.
- **Answers**: "which profile should we actually ship?"

### 14. Per-dimension grouped bars per model ✅ DONE
- **Where**: `smoke-test/dashboard.js::renderDimGroupedChart`,
  `smoke-test/dashboard.html`.
- **What**: one row per model (cold profile only); grouped bars for
  `tool-calling / reasoning / instruction-following / semantic-reasoning`.
- **Answers**: "which model do I pick for workload X?"

### 15. Temperature sweep per dimension ✅ DONE
- **Where**: `smoke-test/dashboard.js::renderTempSweepChart`,
  `smoke-test/dashboard-charts.js`, `tests/dashboard-charts.test.ts`.
- **What**: per (model, dimension), cold / warm / hot grouped bars.
- **Answers**: "is temperature hurting me on dimension X?"
- **Regression covered**: the hot bucket now has explicit data + color coverage
  so it cannot disappear silently.

### 16. Thinking on vs off delta (Qwen) ✅ DONE
- **Where**: `smoke-test/dashboard.js::renderThinkingDeltaChart`,
  `smoke-test/dashboard.html`.
- **What**: two-bar pairs per dimension comparing Qwen thinking off/on at
  matched temperature.
- **Answers**: "is thinking worth the extra decode time, and on which
  dimensions?"

### 17. Time-to-first-token (prefill latency) chart ✅ DONE
- **Where**: `smoke-test/dashboard.js::renderTtftChart`,
  `smoke-test/dashboard.html`.
- **What**: horizontal bar chart of `oneShot.prefillMs` per profile.
- **Answers**: "how long until the first token for each profile?"

### 18. Finish reason breakdown ✅ DONE
- **Where**: `smoke-test/dashboard.js::renderFinishChart`,
  `smoke-test/dashboard.html`.
- **What**: stacked horizontal bars showing `eos / max-tokens / stop-token /
  error / unknown` counts by profile.
- **Answers**: "is this profile producing clean completions, or is it
  running off the end?"

### 19. Score over time (regression detection) ✅ DONE
- **Where**: `smoke-test/dashboard.js::renderSeriesChart`,
  `eval/live-db.ts::loadEvalSeries`, `eval/live-server.ts` `/evals/series`.
- **What**: line chart of `overall` across successive eval runs by profile.
- **Answers**: "did a code change regress anything?"

### 20. Quantization comparison (future — requires multi-quant models)
- **Where**: new panel.
- **What**: same model at q4 vs q8 vs f16 — accuracy delta vs speed delta.
- **Blocker**: today every entry in `eval/models.ts` has exactly one
  quant. Needs multi-quant registrations to be meaningful. Deferred.

### 21. Dedicated Embeddings dashboard section ✅ DONE
- **Where**: `smoke-test/dashboard.html` (new section divider + three
  panels), `smoke-test/dashboard.js`
  (`renderEmbeddingCosineChart` / `renderEmbeddingLatencyChart` /
  `renderEmbeddingThroughputChart`),
  `smoke-test/dashboard-charts.js`
  (`buildEmbeddingCosineChartData` / `buildEmbeddingLatencyChartData` /
  `buildEmbeddingThroughputChartData`),
  `tests/dashboard-charts.test.ts`.
- **What**: separate "Embeddings" section at the bottom of the dashboard
  with three panels — per-task cosine similarity, median ms-per-text
  latency, and texts/sec throughput. Per-dimension grouped chart now
  excludes embedding-only evals and drops the `embedding` column so
  generative-model rows aren't cluttered.
- **Answers**: "how fast and how good is each embedding model?"

### 22. Accuracy × Speed model colour key ✅ DONE
- **Where**: `smoke-test/dashboard.js::renderScatterChart`.
- **What**: scatter dots are grouped by `(modelId, thinking)` into one
  dataset per model+mode, each with its own colour from an 8-stop
  palette. The chart's top legend acts as the colour key. Stable colour
  assignment via sorted keys.
- **Answers**: "which dot is which model?" without needing to hover.

---

## Won't-do (for now)

- **Smaller quants (Q2_K / Q3_K)**: quality/speed tradeoff, not a pipeline improvement.
- **Speculative decoding**: requires a drafter model; large project.
- **Custom kernel fusion beyond GLU**: huge effort, marginal win.

---

## Next Steps

### Decode hotspot decision / rebaseline (2026-04-22 Task 5)
- **Current hotspot:** matmul path tuning remains the lead target.
- **Profile-mode hotspot evidence:** `make smoke-bench PERF_RUNS=3
  PERF_MODEL=tinyllama-1.1b-chat-q4_0` reported median **93.5 tok/s**, median
  run **184 ms prefill**, **331 ms decode**, and **2027 ms wall time** for the
  full page completion. Across 90 single-token greedy decode traces,
  `graphComputeMs` averaged **9.96 ms / 91.8%** of step time while
  `downloadResultMs` averaged **0.62 ms / 5.7%**. Because this came from
  `--profile` mode, use it for hotspot ranking and direction, not as a new
  steady-state throughput claim.
- **Backend attribution:** `backendMatmulMs` averaged **4.02 ms / 40.4% of
  graph time**, ahead of `backendEncodeOverheadMs` (**2.81 ms / 28.2%**) and
  `backendAttentionMs` (**0.40 ms / 4.0%**). `backendDispatchCount` stayed at
  **489** per token; that supports the encode/dispatch-overhead suspicion but
  is not itself a timed bottleneck metric.
- **Decision:** keep structural follow-up deferred. If perf work resumes, the
  current profiled traces suggest keeping the next optimization pass narrow and
  targeting matmul first, with encode overhead as the secondary decode-compute
  suspect.
- **Update (2026-04-22):** Matmul follow-up attempt (increase legacy Q outputs per wg) showed no meaningful retained gain and was reverted.
- **Update (2026-04-25):** baseline moved to ~110 tok/s after the GPU TOP_K
  smoke-loop wiring (commit `9156deb`).
- **Update (2026-04-25, library-as-source-of-truth consolidation):** the
  smoke loop has been deleted and replaced with a thin
  `engine.chatCompletion` adapter; `Generator.generate` now picks the
  decode mode dynamically per step. Numbers in this section pre-date
  both 2026-04-25 changes — **all bucket percentages here are stale**.
  Re-profile first; see "Active next steps §1" below.

### Completed on 2026-04-24 / 2026-04-25 / 2026-04-26 — see `TODO_ARCHIVE.md`

The detailed "Completed on" entries from 2026-04-24, 2026-04-25, and
2026-04-26 live in `TODO_ARCHIVE.md`. They cover: encoder forward
pass bring-up, library consolidation (single-source decode), kernel-
tuning campaign §1-§9 (memory-bound matmul characterization),
wave-1 + wave-2 model fleet rollout, §11-§16 closures (Q3_K bug fix,
quant promotions, qwen3-8b registration), plus 28 numbered bug
fixes. The 2026-04-27 cycle (§21-§26) below is the active reference.

### Completed on 2026-04-27

21. **§D encoder/embedding perf cycle measured + closed.** First dedicated
    perf cycle on the encoder fleet (arctic-embed-s 33M / arctic-embed-m
    109M, both F16). Produced harness infra + diagnostic finding rather than
    a shipped lever; mirrors §17 / §19's measure-and-close pattern. Branch:
    `feat/encoder-perf`. Plan / spec at
    `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-27-encoder-perf-pass.md` /
    `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-27-encoder-perf-pass-design.md`
    (Phase 2.5 closure addendum carries the full lever portfolio).

    **Headline finding (Phase 2.5 diagnostic):** `graphCompute` is **95.6%**
    of `embed()` wall time on arctic-embed-s short. A 33M F16 model has
    ~66 MB of weights — at Apple Silicon's ~200 GB/s memory bandwidth the
    actual compute is <1 ms. The remaining ~31 ms is dispatch /
    kernel-launch overhead: encoder graph has ~390 ops × ~80 µs/dispatch
    ≈ 31 ms (matches measurement exactly). Per-call ctx + graph rebuild
    is <1 ms total; download is ~1 ms; pool is <0.1 ms. **Bottleneck is
    dispatch count, not memory bandwidth or arithmetic.**

    **L1 ctx/graph reuse measured + reverted.** Implemented at `5eb1f73`
    (private graphCache field, ensureGraphCache(N), dispose pops graph
    ctx then weight ctx). Single-text p50 wall ms vs Phase 1 baseline:
    arctic-embed-s short +0.6%, long +2.3%; arctic-embed-m short +2.7%,
    long −9.5%. Three slight regressions plus one bimodal-noise reading
    on m-long (~34 ms cluster + ~38 ms cluster, 50/50 split — not a real
    effect). G1 strict reading: no model dropped ≥10%. Reverted at
    `3a6a366` per gate rule. Cosine 0.76 preserved (G3 part 1) throughout.

    **Lever re-ranking against the Phase 2.5 data:**
    - L1 ctx/graph reuse: targets <1% bucket → measured + reverted.
    - L2 GPU-side pool / readback shrink: targets ~3% bucket → not worth
      shipping for ~1 ms.
    - L3 embedBatch sequential loop: zero amortization on dispatch count
      → no-op on the dominant bucket.
    - L4 concat-graph batched compute: only lever with structural headroom
      (potentially 4-8× via dispatch amortization at K≤8). Was explicitly
      listed as non-goal in the spec; correctness-risky (block-diagonal
      mask up to ~85 MB at K=64 batchMixed; or full 4D padded batch
      refactor of `buildGraph`); deferred to future cycle gated on a real
      use-case for batch encoder throughput.

    **Cycle closes per the spec's stop rule:** "a lever's measured impact
    is in the noise AND nothing else profiles as a hotspot → close early;
    document what was tried." L1's null result + Phase 2.5's
    dispatch-overhead characterization rules out L2 / L3-sequential
    without measurement; L4 is out of scope.

    **What ships on `main` from this cycle:**
    - `eval/embed-perf.ts` harness CLI + `EmbedPerfTrace` /
      `waitForEmbedPerfResult` in `eval/browser-smoke.ts`.
    - `eval/fixtures/embed-prompts.ts` pinned text fixtures (short / long
      / batchMixed).
    - `smoke-test/real-model-page.js` `?embedPerf=<single|batch>&embedReps=<N>&embedFixture=<id>`
      URL-param hooks (causal-LM and encoder branches; default off).
    - `Makefile` `embed-perf` + `embed-perf-baseline` targets.
    - `tests/encoder-cosine-parity.test.ts` G3 baseline guard
      (`eval/reports/embed-perf-baseline-cosine.json`, 0.76 ±0.005).
    - `eval/reports/embed-perf-2026-04-27-baseline/` (Phase 1) +
      `eval/reports/embed-perf-2026-04-27-L1/` (L1 negative result)
      raw measurement logs.

    **What's reverted:** `feat(encoder): L1 same-graph-cache across
    embed() calls` (`5eb1f73` reverted by `3a6a366`).

    **Future-cycle resurrection paths:**
    - **Concat-graph batched compute** (deferred L4). Open if a real
      use-case for batch encoder throughput emerges. Implementation
      options at that point: (a) flat concat + block-diagonal mask at
      K≤8 (4-8× ceiling); (b) padded 4D batch dim (cleaner; full
      `buildGraph` rewrite). Harness from this cycle is ready to measure
      against G2.
    - **Larger encoder registration** (deferred wave-2). If `bge-m3` or
      `gte-large-en-v1.5` lands, single-text p50 may flip from
      dispatch-bound to compute/bandwidth-bound — at which point L1
      (and possibly L2) regain relevance. Re-measure then.
    - **Backend-side dispatch coalescing** in upstream `ggml-webgpu`. If
      that ever lands, addresses the §D bucket for free; re-run this
      cycle's harness on a future llama.cpp rebase to spot it.

    **Net characterization of the encoder fleet at this scale:** the
    encoder embed loop is **dispatch-bound, not compute-bound**. Single-
    text levers are exhausted; the only structural lever is dispatch
    amortization across multiple texts in one graph. For deployments that
    don't need batch encoder throughput, no perf work is justified at
    this scale; current numbers (34-52 ms p50) are the practical floor
    until either a use-case emerges or upstream `ggml-webgpu` improves.

22. **§22 7B+ long-prefill graph-buffer tiling — SHIP GATED.** First
    direct attack on the §20 long-prefill abort; mirrors §17/§18/§19/§20/§21's
    measure-and-close pattern. Branch: `feat/prefill-tiling-22`. Raw
    matrix at `eval/reports/prefill-tiling-2026-04-27/SUMMARY.md`;
    Phase 0 diagnostic at `00-phase0-diagnostic.txt` in the same dir.

    **Headline finding (Phase 0 surprise):** the §20 abort is **not**
    the WebGPU max-buffer-binding cap as that closure hypothesized.
    It is the **host-side ggml graph allocator** at `ggml-alloc.c:82`
    (`ggml_tallocr_alloc: not enough space … node_510 needed 8011776,
    available 475648`). The cap is per-graph-buffer in the CPU-side
    metadata context, not a GPU device limit. Tiling the prefill into
    smaller chunks keeps each graph's working-set under the allocator's
    available budget, which is why it works.

    **Matrix (5 cells, prefill-512 for 7B+, prefill-256 for TinyLlama):**

    | Cell | Model | Prefill | Tile | Prefill (ms) | Decode (tok/s) | Status |
    |------|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
    | 1 | tinyllama-1.1b-chat-q4_0      | 256 |   0 |  289 | 101.9 | works (control) |
    | 2 | tinyllama-1.1b-chat-q4_0      | 256 | 128 |  524 | 106.9 | works — Δ TTFT +81.3%, Δ decode +4.9% |
    | 3 | mistral-7b-instruct-v0.3-q4ks | 512 |   0 |  —   |   —   | aborts (`node_510 needed 8011776, available 475648` — confirms §20) |
    | 4 | mistral-7b-instruct-v0.3-q4ks | 512 | 128 | 4368 |  33.6 | works (unblock; matches §18's 34.5 baseline within noise) |
    | 5 | qwen3-8b-iq3m                 | 512 | 128 | 4518 |  16.2 | works (unblock; matches §18's 15.1 baseline within noise) |

    TinyLlama tile=0 vs tile=128 produced bytewise-identical output
    (sampling-level equivalence holds). All 7B+ visible answers were
    coherent on-topic English.

    **Decision-rule evaluation:**
    - TinyLlama TTFT regression at tile=128: **+81.3%** vs ≤3% gate → **FAIL**.
    - TinyLlama decode at tile=128: +4.9% (improvement) → directionally pass.
    - Mistral-7B unblock at tile=128: **YES** — exact §20 abort signature avoided.
    - Qwen3-8B unblock at tile=128: **YES**.
    - **Decision: ship gated** (default-off, opt-in for 7B+).

    **What ships on `feat/prefill-tiling-22` (default-off plumbing):**
    `prefillTileSize?: number` ctor option on `ModelInference`
    (drafter accepts it too for symmetry; default `0` = legacy
    single-graph prefill — Task 1 `c38fb8f`); tile dispatcher in
    the prefill path that splits into `ceil(N/tile)` sequential
    graph dispatches when the prompt exceeds the tile and an
    equivalence test stub (Task 2 `f281ac3`); smoke-page
    `?prefillTile=N` URL param (Task 3 `2fcc334`); `eval/perf.ts`
    `--prefill-tile <n>` flag (Task 4 `18e1677`) plus a
    placeholder Makefile harness target; Phase 0 diagnostic
    capture under the original §20 hypothesis (Task 0 `8e21036`,
    kept as evidence); 5-cell matrix raw logs (Task 5 `5b5705a`)
    under `eval/reports/prefill-tiling-2026-04-27/`.

    **Why default-off rather than default-on:** the TinyLlama
    +81.3% TTFT regression at tile=128 is real, not noise. Each
    prefill tile is one extra ggml graph build + dispatch +
    post-pass; for a 1.1B model whose prefill-256 already fits in
    a single graph the overhead dominates. The gate keeps the
    small-model fast path untouched while letting 7B+ callers opt
    into the unblock.

    **Future-resurrection paths (not landed; reopen on demand):**
    (a) **Per-model auto-default** — add `recommendedPrefillTile?:
    number` to the model registry and select tile=128 automatically
    for 7B+ entries; cheap follow-on, deliberately deferred per
    this branch's ship-gated scope. (b) **tile=64 fallback** —
    untested but cheap if a future model hits the same
    `ggml_tallocr_alloc` abort at tile=128 (larger embedding-dim
    or layer-count pushing per-tile working-set over budget) before
    reopening the upstream allocator question. (c) **Revisit tile
    size if upstream ggml's graph allocator becomes more
    memory-efficient** — lifts the floor and may let the gate flip
    to default-on without TinyLlama regression; track on the next
    llama.cpp rebase.

    **Interaction with §C-v2-A (side branch).** §22 partially
    alleviates the verify-cost lever for short prefills, but the
    K+1 verify cost on 8B+ at the canonical target/drafter ratio
    was **not** measured here. §C-v2-A resurrection still needs
    long-prefill graph-buffer rework that §22 sidesteps (per-tile
    dispatch overhead) rather than fixes (per-graph allocator
    headroom). Treat §22 as a partial unblock for §C-v2-A, not a
    full resurrection trigger.

23. **§22 default-on auto-tile via per-model registry — LANDED.**
    Cheap follow-on to §22; promotes the 7B+ unblock from opt-in
    to right-by-default while preserving the sub-7B fast path.
    Single commit on `main` (`0c50e03`).

    **What ships:**
    - `eval/models.ts`: new `recommendedPrefillTile?: number`
      field on `BenchmarkModel`. Set to `128` on the five 7B+
      entries (mistral-7b-instruct-v0.3-q4ks / -q3km / -iq4xs,
      llama-3.1-8b-instruct-iq3m, qwen3-8b-iq3m). Sub-7B entries
      leave the field unset.
    - `eval/perf.ts`: when `--prefill-tile` is omitted, falls
      back to `model.recommendedPrefillTile`. Explicit
      `--prefill-tile <n>` (including `0`) still wins.
    - `smoke-test/real-model-page.js`: mirror map
      `RECOMMENDED_PREFILL_TILE` keyed by model id (data
      duplication, not logic — bundle / browser boundary
      precludes importing `eval/models.ts`). When `?prefillTile=`
      is absent, falls back to the map; explicit
      `?prefillTile=N` (including `0`) still wins.
    - `tests/eval-models.test.ts`: 2 registry-shape tests pin
      the contract (all 7B+ entries default to 128; no sub-7B
      entry sets the field). 424 → 426 pass.

    **Behaviour after this change:** `bun run eval/perf.ts
    --model qwen3-8b-iq3m` with no `--prefill-tile` flag
    auto-applies tile=128. Opening
    `?model=mistral-7b-instruct-v0.3-q4ks` in the smoke page
    with no `?prefillTile=` does the same. TinyLlama and other
    sub-7B paths are bit-identical to pre-§23 (no map entry,
    falls through to the existing `0` default). Force-disable
    on a 7B+ model still works via explicit `?prefillTile=0` /
    `--prefill-tile 0` for regression sweeps.

    **Why two maps instead of one source of truth:** the smoke
    page is plain JS loaded as a page module; the model registry
    lives in `eval/models.ts` (TS, harness-side). They sit on
    opposite sides of the bundle / browser boundary.
    Cross-importing would either bundle eval into the browser
    surface or break the harness's Node-only imports. The map in
    `real-model-page.js` is data, not logic, and the registry
    field's docstring + the smoke-page comment both call out the
    mirror requirement. A future cycle could fold the map into
    the smoke bundle if drift becomes a problem.

    **Future-resurrection paths (not landed; reopen on demand):**
    (a) **tile=64 fallback in the map** for any future model
    that hits `ggml_tallocr_alloc` at tile=128 (larger
    embedding-dim or layer-count pushing per-tile working-set
    over budget). (b) **Heuristic-based default in
    `ModelInference`** — derive the recommended tile from
    `hyperparams.layerCount × embeddingLength` rather than from
    a hand-curated list. Cleaner, but defers the "is the
    heuristic right" question until a model trips it; the
    explicit map is fine while the 7B+ fleet is small enough to
    enumerate. (c) **Bundle the map into the smoke bundle** if
    drift between the two registries causes a real bug; the
    cycle's commit message + the doc comments in both files
    are the current guard.

24. **§4 FA revisit at 7B+ long-prefill — CLOSED.** Direct
    follow-on to §22+§23 — re-ran the §20 matrix on the 3 cells §20
    could not capture (Mistral-7B-Q4_K_S, Llama-3.1-8B-IQ3_M,
    Qwen3-8B-IQ3_M × {short-short, long-short, short-long, long-long}
    × FA off/on, 24 cells, 3-trial median) with §23's
    `recommendedPrefillTile=128` auto-default unblocking long-prefill
    on 7B+. Landed on `main` directly; zero `src/` change.

    **TTFT (prefill ms, p50):**

    | Model     | short-short | long-short | short-long | long-long |
    |---|---|---|---|---|
    | mistral-7b-q4ks  | 878 → 847 (-3.5%)   | 4723 → 4865 (+3.0%) | 869 → 865 (-0.5%)  | 5582 → 4569 (-18.1%) |
    | llama-3.1-8b-iq3m | 791 → 770 (-2.7%)  | 4737 → 4716 (-0.4%) | 788 → 781 (-0.9%)  | 4914 → 4555 (-7.3%)  |
    | qwen3-8b-iq3m    | 476 → 493 (+3.6%)   | 4880 → 4877 (-0.1%) | 478 → 475 (-0.6%)  | 6348 → 4871 (-23.3%) |

    **Decode tok/s (p50):**

    | Model     | short-short | long-short | short-long | long-long |
    |---|---|---|---|---|
    | mistral-7b-q4ks  | 33.7 → 32.2 (-4.5%) | 31.1 → 30.9 (-0.6%) | 33.6 → 31.4 (-6.5%) | 30.1 → 30.3 (+0.7%) |
    | llama-3.1-8b-iq3m | 16.7 → 16.6 (-0.6%) | 16.7 → 16.7 (+0.0%) | 16.6 → 16.5 (-0.6%) | 16.5 → 16.5 (+0.0%) |
    | qwen3-8b-iq3m    | 15.5 → 15.2 (-1.9%) | 15.7 → 16.0 (+1.9%) | 15.5 → 14.9 (-3.9%) | 15.7 → 15.9 (+1.3%) |

    **Decision-rule evaluation:**
    - **A. Ship default-on:** *FAIL.* Mistral short-short decode
      regresses -4.5% and Qwen3-8B short-short TTFT regresses +3.6%
      (both >3% gate); zero models gain ≥2% on short-long decode.
    - **B. Ship gated (auto, FA on for `nTokens > 1`):** *FAIL.*
      Long-short TTFT deltas across the three 7B+ models (+3.0%,
      -0.4%, -0.1%) are all ≤5% — zero models meet the gated-ship
      threshold. The seq² avoidance win that helped TinyLlama at
      long-short (-10.0%) does not materialize at 7B+/IQ3_M shape.
    - **C. Close §4 again:** *FIRES (default).*

    **Net characterization:** FA stays behind the manual chain at
    7B+ across the canonical 4-workload matrix at prefill-512 —
    matmul is already 65-70% of decode time at this shape, and FA's
    per-step overhead exceeds the prefill saving on three of four
    workloads. The exception is **long-long TTFT** (Mistral -18.1%,
    Qwen3-8B -23.3%, Llama -7.3%) where the cumulative `pastLen`
    during decode amortizes the seq²-avoidance — but neither §20
    rule clause keys on long-long TTFT, and long-long decode tok/s
    wins are tiny (+0.7% / 0.0% / +1.3%), so this characterization
    flag does not flip the ship decision. It is a useful datapoint
    for future spec-decode / long-context cycles.

    **Files retained as future infra:** unchanged from §20 —
    `flashAttn?: boolean` ctor option, `?fa=on` URL param,
    `--fa <on|off>` perf.ts flag, F16 mask + dual V-cache layout,
    `eval/fixtures/long-prompts.ts` fixtures (prefill-256 / -512 /
    -1024), 5 contract tests at `tests/fa-mode-config.test.ts`.

    **Cycle infrastructure:** new files —
    `eval/reports/fa-revisit-7b-2026-04-27/{run-matrix.sh,
    SUMMARY.md, 01-coherence.txt, *.log}` (24 cell logs +
    matrix-driver script + coherence transcripts). Reuses §20's
    plumbing + §22+§23's auto-tile end-to-end. Zero `src/` change;
    zero new tests. `make checkall` remains 426 / 11 / 0.

    **Plan reference:** `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-27-fa-revisit-7b-long-prefill.md`.

    **Next lever with measured headroom:** §C-v2-A resurrection
    is the most promising candidate (§22's tile=128 partially
    alleviates the per-step K+1 verify cost — needs a fresh
    measurement cycle on the side branch under
    `prefillTileSize=128` to settle whether tiled-verify drops
    per-step cost enough to break the K=4 even-α ceiling at
    8B IQ3_M × 0.6B Q8). MEMORY64 for 70B-class targets and §D
    concat-graph batched encoder compute remain conditional on
    use-case; a heuristic-based prefill-tile default in
    `ModelInference` (§23 follow-on) is a nice-to-have when the
    7B+ fleet outgrows hand-curation. All explicitly conditional
    — pick on demand.

    **§26 measured + closed §C-v2-A resurrection.** See §26 below.

26. **§26 §C-v2-A re-measurement under §22 tile=128 — CLOSED.**
    Direct empirical test of §24's parting recommendation. Cherry-
    picked the 4 §22 implementation commits (`c38fb8f`, `f281ac3`,
    `2fcc334`, `18e1677` — skipped `8e21036` Phase-0 diagnostic and
    `5b5705a` Task-5 matrix; skipped §23 registry auto-default for
    variable isolation) onto `feat/spec-decode-v2-greedy`. Added one
    conflict-resolution recipe in `smoke-test/real-model-page.js`
    (drop §22 Task 3's references to `diagnoseAlloc` and `embedPerf`
    blocks not present on the side branch). Re-ran the §C-v2-A
    4-cell gate matrix under explicit `--prefill-tile 128` on both
    target and drafter `ModelInference` ctors. 3 outer trials × 3
    perf.ts internal runs = 9 measurements per cell, 36 total.

    **Matrix (median of three 3-run trial-medians):**

    | Cell | Workload         | Drafter | Decode tok/s p50 | Prefill ms p50 |
    |------|------------------|---------|-----------------:|---------------:|
    | 1    | prefill-256      | —       | 15.8             | 2684           |
    | 2    | creative-low-α   | —       | 15.8             | 1721           |
    | 3    | prefill-256      | K=4     | 6.7              | 3166           |
    | 4    | creative-low-α   | K=4     | 8.5              | 1530           |

    **Gates (decisive failures):**
    - **Gate 1 (speedup ≥1.5×):** 6.7 / 15.8 = **0.42×** — FAIL by 3.6×.
    - **Gate 2 (safety ≥0.95×):** 8.5 / 15.8 = **0.54×** — FAIL by 0.4×.

    **Cross-cycle vs §C-v2-A close (`646320c`, tile=0):** baselines
    drift -1.3% / -2.5% (within ±10% threshold); cell 3 drifts +17.5%
    (5.7 → 6.7, marginal improvement, gate-1 gap to 1.5× is still
    3.6×); cell 4 drifts -33% (12.7 → 8.5, **significant safety
    regression** — most likely later AdaptiveGate fire or less-
    effective post-disengage tail under tile=128 plumbing). The
    cell-4 drift is large enough to flag for any future v2-A
    resurrection cycle.

    **Verdict:** the K+1=5 verify graph is three orders of magnitude
    below the 128-token tile threshold and is never split. tile=128
    therefore cannot affect verify cost on this workload. The
    +17.5% cell-3 improvement is real but irrelevant to the gate;
    no incremental lever (better drafter, tighter K, faster cache)
    closes the 3.6× gap to 1.5×. **§C-v2-A is closed under all
    known levers.**

    **Resurrection paths still open (architectural change required):**
    (a) **Faster K+1 verify** via upstream ggml-webgpu dispatch
    coalescing or fused-graph optimization that drops per-step
    verify cost below ~30 ms — re-measure if upstream lands such an
    improvement. (b) **MEMORY64 → 70B-class target** to shift
    target/drafter param ratio from 13× to ~100× (Leviathan-style
    speculation regime). Multi-day engineering; conditional on a
    concrete 70B+ deployment ask.

    **Side branch retained as archived infra.** `feat/spec-decode-
    v2-greedy` tip moves from `646320c` to **`6b20aad`** with the

exceed A's 3% gate (Mistral decode -4.5%, Qwen3-8B TTFT +3.6%).
FA does win long-long TTFT (-7.3% to -23.3%) but neither §20
rule clause keys on long-long. Gate stays default-off as future
infra; zero `src/` change. With those closures, the remaining
headroom is the deferred concat-graph batched compute lever for
encoders (only opens on a batch-throughput use-case) plus
MEMORY64 for 70B-class targets, and §C-v2-A resurrection (§22
partially alleviates per-step K+1 verify cost — never
re-measured under tile=128 since §22 landed).
**§25 (2026-04-27 — LANDED, 10+ commits) dashboard hygiene +
new visualization cycle.** Five new charts on the main inference
tab (`f8e0ae6` family-coloured accuracy×speed scatter,
`b33f019` quant connector lines, `e4978ae` decode tok/s vs
param-count scatter, `5af0370` per-dim score heatmap, `504c837`
latest-vs-prior delta columns on runs+evals tables); explicit
encoder/BERT filter so the main tab is strictly chat-only
(`02f7872`); three encoder-side analogs under the Embeddings
section (`845b687` cosine×latency scatter, `cf4c49d` param×
throughput scatter, `88f3df5` Δ total ms on embeddings table);
delta polarity fix so lower-is-better metrics (`Δ total ms`)
read green=speedup / red=regression (`620407e`). DB audit
during the cycle confirmed `smoke-runs.db` is clean (29 runs /
30 evals, no purge candidates). A `/models` endpoint
refactor on `eval/live-server.ts` (`11c1626`) drives
`isEncoderModel` / `inferEncoderParamCountM` from the registry
instead of hand-maintained id-prefix maps — eliminates the
latent footgun where registering a new encoder family
(nomic-embed-*, e5-*) would silently leak encoder rows back
onto the main tab. Contract test pinned at `14038e2`. Two
narrower follow-ups remain: (a) `inferModelFamily` still uses
id-prefix matching (registry's `family` field could replace it
but the family-color palette is keyed off inferred labels;
small palette/key audit needed); (b) the encoder-architecture
check still hardcodes `architecture === "bert"` — if a
non-BERT encoder ever lands, update `isEncoderModel` and
`inferEncoderParamCountM`. Ship gate (427/11/0) maintained on
every commit.
**§26 (2026-04-27 — CLOSED, side-branch + 3 main commits) §C-v2-A
re-measurement under §22 tile=128.** Direct empirical test of
§24's parting recommendation. Cherry-picked the 4 §22
implementation commits (`c38fb8f`, `f281ac3`, `2fcc334`,
`18e1677`) onto `feat/spec-decode-v2-greedy`; ran the canonical
4-cell gate matrix at qwen3-8b-iq3m × qwen3-0.6b-q4f16 K=4 with
explicit `--prefill-tile 128` on both target and drafter. Gate 1
(speedup ≥1.5×): **0.42×** — FAIL by 3.6×. Gate 2 (safety ≥0.95×):
**0.54×** — FAIL by 0.4×. The K+1=5 verify graph is three orders
of magnitude below the 128-token tile threshold and is never
split, so tile=128 cannot affect verify cost on this workload —
exactly as the spec hypothesized. Cell 4 drift -33% vs §C-v2-A
close (12.7 → 8.5) is a notable safety regression flagged for any
future v2-A resurrection. **§C-v2-A definitively closed under all
known levers**; resurrection now requires architectural change
(faster K+1 verify via upstream ggml-webgpu dispatch coalescing,
OR MEMORY64 → 70B+ target shifting the target/drafter ratio from
13× to ~100×). Side branch retained as archived infra; do not
merge. Files on main: spec `b23ccc9`, plan `f0a682c`, TODO closure
`e715160`. Files on side branch: cherry-picks + matrix + SUMMARY,
tip `6b20aad`. Zero `src/` change on `main`; checkall remains
427/11/0.
**§27 (2026-04-27 — LANDED, 3 main commits) llama.cpp rebase
+ free-win sweep.** Rebased `webllm-browser-patches`
`78433f606 → 434b2a1ff` (13-commit upstream delta, 3 in
`ggml-webgpu/`: Q1_0 #22374, fast i-quant mat-vec #22344,
register-tile/subgroup matmul tuning #22241). Zero conflicts;
all 11 patches replayed cleanly; new tip `981859864`. Safety
branch `webllm-browser-patches-pre-rebase-2026-04-27`. WASM
binary +32 KB (new kernels); checkall 427/11/0; browser
smoke clean. Bench-inference sweep on 6 models against §17
"pre-§A change" baselines uncovered a **+70-80% free win on
IQ3_M models** isolated to upstream's #22344 (fast i-quant
mat-vec):
- **qwen3-8b-iq3m**: 15.1 → 27.2 tok/s (+80%)
- **llama-3.1-8b-iq3m**: 16.8 → 29.0 tok/s (+73%)
- mistral-7b-q4ks (K-quant control): 34.5 → 35.8 (+3.8%, noise)
- mistral-7b-iq4xs (i-quant 7B): no §17 baseline; lands at
  35.6 tok/s — *tied with K-quant Q4_K_S at the same model
  size*, where pre-rebase the i-quant decompression overhead
  would have made it slower. Confirms #22344 closed the
  i-quant penalty across the IQ family.
- tinyllama-q4_0: 105.7 → 110.8 (+4.8%)
- qwen3-0.6b-q8: ~85 → 89.8 (+5.6%)
- qwen3-1.7b-q8 (17-tok warmup-dominated): ~59 → 62.2 (+5.4%)
Profile-mode rebench on `qwen3-8b-iq3m` (`make smoke-bench
PERF_RUNS=3`, 60-step trace) confirmed dispatch count
unchanged at **805/token** (pure kernel speedup, not graph
restructure); matmul **48.04 → 23.07 ms** (-52%); matmul
share **70.5% → 55.0%** (-15.5 pp, still lead bucket).
**§16's 16.2 baseline for `qwen3-8b-iq3m` is obsolete;
canonical bench-inf is now 27.2 tok/s.** The 8B+ fleet
effectively doubled at zero patch cost. Commits on main:
`db50d28` (rebase docs), `ccf2abb` (free-win sweep),
`7402e4b` (profile-mode breakdown).
**§28 (2026-04-28 — CLOSED, side-branch + 1 main commit)
§C-v2-A re-measurement post-§27 rebase.** Direct test of
whether the +80% target speedup from §27 reopens the lever.
Re-ran §26's 4-cell gate matrix on `feat/spec-decode-v2-greedy`
against the rebuilt WASM. Both gates **worsened**, not
improved: gate 1 = 9.7 / 28.2 = **0.34×** (was 0.42×); gate
2 = 12.7 / 28.4 = **0.45×** (was 0.54×). Target baseline
scaled +78% (15.8 → 28.2 tok/s) but drafted path only
+45-49% — drafter `qwen3-0.6b-q4f16` is Q8_0, not i-quant,
so K=4 drafter forwards retain pre-rebase cost; only the
K+1=5 verify benefits from #22344, and that saving is
amortized across 5 tokens. The §26 "resurrection path (a)
— faster K+1 verify" is now **empirically closed**: the
rebase delivered exactly that and gates moved *against*
the thresholds, not toward. Drafter overhead must scale
symmetrically with target speedup or the relative ratio
worsens. Resurrection paths still on the table: (b)
MEMORY64 → 70B+ target (unchanged). Path (c) "smaller
i-quant drafter that also uses #22344" was opened here as
a new theoretical path, then **CLOSED 2026-04-28 by direct
verify-cost probe** — see §29 below. Side branch tip
`9bdd707` carries the §28 matrix + SUMMARY at
`eval/reports/spec-decode-v2-tile128-postrebase-2026-04-28/`;
side branch tip `4e11d79` adds VERIFY-COST-PROBE.md in
the same directory.
TODO ref: `d10971b` on main. Zero `src/` change on `main`;
checkall remains 427/11/0.

Findings, one bug fix, one upstream rebase, one
quant-promotion, encoder perf characterization, plus a
dashboard hygiene pass from these sessions:

- **Bug #28 (Q3_K shader) FIXED — see §14.** Root cause was
  UB shift-by-32 in `load_u32_at_src{,0}` u32 loader helpers
  (`hi << (32u - shift)` when `shift == 0`), corrupting any
  aligned read through these helpers. Q3_K mul_mat_vec and
  Q3_K get_rows are the user-visible victims; Q4_K_S happened
  to use unaligned reads and was unaffected. Patch 11 on
  `webllm-browser-patches` (`a536df4f4` after rebase, was
  `391c59f39` pre-rebase). Q3_K_M now coherent at 24.4 tok/s
  on Mistral-7B; Q4_K_S regression-safe at 36.0 tok/s.
- **llama.cpp rebased to upstream `434b2a1ff` (2026-04-27).**
  13-commit gap from prior base `78433f606`; zero conflicts;
  all 11 patches replayed cleanly. 3 of the 13 commits touched
  `ggml-webgpu/` (Q1_0 kernel #22374, fast i-quant mat-vec
  kernels #22344, performance-portable register-tile / subgroup
  matmul tuning #22241) — none collided with our patch surface
  (LAYER_NORM via `row_norm.wgsl`, browser ASYNCIFY,
  request-based readback API, profiling, UB shift-by-32 fix).
  Post-rebase verification: WASM build clean (~32 KB binary
  growth from new kernels); checkall 427/11/0; browser smoke on
  TinyLlama Q4_0 reported 120 tok/s decode (above the 105
  steady-state baseline) and encoder cosine 0.76 (matches §21
  pin → patches 9-10 LAYER_NORM healthy); zero console
  errors/warnings. Tip is now `981859864`. Safety branch
  preserved at `webllm-browser-patches-pre-rebase-2026-04-27`.
- **Free-win sweep (2026-04-27, post-rebase):** ran
  `bun run eval/perf.ts --runs 3` on six models against the
  §17 "pre-§A change" bench-inf baseline table. **Headline:
  upstream's fast i-quant mat-vec kernels (#22344) delivered
  a +70-80% throughput win on IQ3_M models — the entire 8B+
  fleet got faster for free.**

  | Model                         | Quant   | §17 base | Post-rebase | Δ |
  |---|---|---:|---:|---:|
  | tinyllama-1.1b-chat-q4_0      | Q4_0    | 105.7   | 110.8       | +4.8% |
  | qwen3-0.6b-q4f16              | Q8_0    | ~85     | 89.8        | +5.6% |
  | qwen3-1.7b-q4f16              | Q8_0    | ~59*    | 62.2*       | +5.4% |
  | mistral-7b-instruct-v0.3-q4ks | Q4_K_S  | 34.5    | 35.8        | +3.8% |
  | **llama-3.1-8b-instruct-iq3m**| **IQ3_M** | **16.8** | **29.0** | **+72.6%** |
  | **qwen3-8b-iq3m**             | **IQ3_M** | **15.1** | **27.2** | **+80.1%** |

  \* qwen3-1.7b numbers are 17-token warmup-dominated runs
  (`Tell one short joke.` elicits short Qwen replies); not the
  117-token clean steady-state from the TODO header.

  **Story confirmed by quant-family pattern:** the i-quant
  jump is isolated to IQ3_M (both 8B models, both families).
  K-quant (Q4_K_S Mistral) is essentially flat (+3.8% ≈ noise),
  consistent with #22344 targeting only the i-quant decompression
  path. Dense quants (Q4_0 / Q8_0) all sit at +4-6%, plausibly
  attributable to upstream's register-tile / subgroup matmul
  tuning (#22241).

  **Implications:**
  - The 8B fleet's effective throughput nearly doubled. §16's
    "16.2 tok/s" baseline for `qwen3-8b-iq3m` is now obsolete;
    canonical bench-inf number is **27.2 tok/s**.
  - **§C-v2-A target/drafter ratio analysis shifts —
    EMPIRICALLY SETTLED 2026-04-28 (§28).** Re-ran §26's 4-cell
    gate matrix on side branch `feat/spec-decode-v2-greedy`
    against the rebuilt WASM. Both gates **worsened**, not
    improved: gate 1 = 9.7 / 28.2 = **0.34×** (was 0.42×);
    gate 2 = 12.7 / 28.4 = **0.45×** (was 0.54×). Target
    baseline scaled +78% (15.8 → 28.2 tok/s) but drafted path
    only +45-49% — the drafter (qwen3-0.6b Q8_0) doesn't use
    the i-quant code path, so K=4 drafter forwards retain their
    pre-rebase cost; only the K+1=5 verify pass got faster, and
    that saving is amortized across 5 tokens. The §26
    "resurrection path (a) — faster K+1 verify" is now
    empirically closed: the rebase delivered exactly that and
    the gates moved *against* the thresholds, not toward them.
    Drafter overhead must scale symmetrically with target
    speedup or the relative ratio worsens. Resurrection path
    (c, new in §28) "smaller i-quant drafter that also uses
    #22344" was **CLOSED 2026-04-28 by §29 verify-cost probe**:
    verify is 210 ms/call (5.9× a solo-decode step) and 83% of
    cycle time, so the drafter→0 ceiling is 11.3 tok/s = 0.40×
    the 28.2 tok/s baseline — fails both gates regardless of
    drafter cost. Path (b) MEMORY64 → 70B+ target is the only
    remaining theoretical path. Side branch tip `9bdd707`
    carries the §28 matrix + SUMMARY at
    `eval/reports/spec-decode-v2-tile128-postrebase-2026-04-28/`;
    side branch tip `4e11d79` adds VERIFY-COST-PROBE.md.
    **§C-v2-A remains closed under all known levers.**
  - **§17 / §A reopening:** §A's lever 1 was reverted because
    `MUL_ACC_Q4_0` showed only -2.9% matmul / +0.6% tok/s on
    TinyLlama; the wave-2 7B+ fleet was structurally
    inapplicable (K-quant TPB=16, IQ3_M routes through
    `mul_mat.wgsl` not `mul_mat_vec.wgsl`). With IQ3_M now
    fast, §A remains closed for the wrong reason that already
    closed it (lever shape doesn't apply); no change.
  - **Net characterization update at 8B IQ3_M (post-rebase,
    measured 2026-04-27 via `make smoke-bench
    PERF_MODEL=qwen3-8b-iq3m PERF_RUNS=3`, 60-step trace):**

    | Bucket                  | §17 baseline (profile) | Post-rebase (profile) | Δ |
    |---|---:|---:|---:|
    | tok/s (profile mode)    | 14.3                   | 22.0                  | +54% |
    | graphComputeMs (median) | ~68 ms                 | 42.60 ms              | -37% |
    | backendMatmulMs (median)| 48.04 ms               | 23.07 ms              | **-52%** |
    | backendMatmulMs %graph  | 70.5%                  | 55.0%                 | -15.5 pp |
    | backendEncodeOverheadMs |  ~?                    |  4.50 ms / 10.7%      | — |
    | backendAttentionMs      |  ~?                    |  0.72 ms /  1.7%      | — |
    | backendDispatchCount    | 805/token              | 805/token             | unchanged |

    Dispatch count is bit-identical pre/post — the win is
    pure kernel speedup (#22344 i-quant mat-vec) on the same
    graph, not a graph-shape change. Matmul share dropped
    **15.5 percentage points** but is still the lead bucket
    (55.0% of graph). Encode overhead is now the secondary
    suspect at ~10.7%; attention is negligible (1.7%).

    Profile-mode perturbation also shrank: 27.2 (non-profile)
    → 22.0 (profile) is **-19%** vs the historical -29 to -34%
    on Q4_0/Q8_0 — fewer per-dispatch timestamp samples are
    bottlenecking IQ3_M now that the kernel itself is faster.

    **No new lever exposed.** Matmul still leads at 55% but the
    absolute win remaining (halve again → ~10% step gain) is
    smaller than the levers already closed (§A 0.6%, §18 -5.8%,
    §19 0.20× regress). Encode overhead at 10.7% × ~22 tok/s
    means a hypothetical encode-elimination would max out at
    ~10% gain — also below the 1.5× ship-gate threshold for
    new infrastructure work.

  Free-win sweep duration: ~5 minutes wall (one rebuild +
  smoke-restart per model). Sweep done — no follow-on work
  triggered.
- **llama.cpp rebased to upstream `78433f606` (2026-04-26).**
  6-commit gap from prior base `b760272f1`; zero conflicts.
  None of the 6 commits touch `ggml-webgpu/`, WGSL shaders,
  ASYNCIFY, or the graph-visit code we patched. Upstream
  delta was: backend-meta recurrent state fix (we don't use
  recurrent state); CUDA/CPU/OpenCL backend changes (we
  build none of them); CODEOWNERS update. Safety branch
  preserved at `webllm-browser-patches-pre-rebase-2026-04-26`.
- **Workarounds for the 4 GiB WASM cap:** Q4_K_S works at
  7B (3953 MB Mistral). For 8B+, Q4_K_S exceeds the cap;
  IQ3_M / IQ3_S are the smaller-bandwidth working
  alternatives via the IQ-family code path (3609 MB Llama-
  3.1-8B, ~3252 MB Qwen3-8B IQ3_XXS). MEMORY64 to bump
  the cap to 8 GiB requires the wasm memory64 proposal —
  multi-day engineering effort, not a flag flip.
- **§A subgroup-cooperative loading CLOSED 2026-04-26 (§17).**
  Original subgroup-broadcast premise rejected on inspection
  (kernel already partitions src0 perfectly across threads;
  no redundant loads to coalesce). Lever-1 replacement
  (THREADS_PER_BLOCK 4→2) measured on the 4-baseline harness:
  only TinyLlama Q4_0 benefited (sub-trigger -2.9% matmul /
  +0.6% tok/s — noise). Q4_K_S (Mistral) is a K-quant with
  TPB=16 and a different block layout (structurally excluded
  from §A's design); IQ3_M (both 8Bs) has no `mul_mat_vec.wgsl`
  path and routes through general `mul_mat.wgsl` instead.
  Levers 2 + 3 face the same applicability constraint. Shader
  reverted; no patches landed.
- **§4 Flash Attention enable CLOSED 2026-04-26 (§18).**
  Integrated `ggml_flash_attn_ext` into all three attention
  branches (decode, prefill, debug-checkpoint) with F16 KV
  cache + transposed V layout. Measured on the 4-baseline:
  FA engaged on all 4 (dispatch counts -10-13%, matmul
  -2 to -16%), but the new `backendAttentionMs` overhead
  (1.3-3.3 ms/step) exceeds savings at single-token decode.
  Mistral-7B regressed -5.8% (blocking — exceeds 3% gate);
  no model gained ≥2%. **FA's main wins are prefill (long
  prompts) and longer decode batches (>256 tokens) — neither
  is exercised by the bench-inf gate.** Bridge wrappers,
  TS bindings, surface test retained as future-work
  infrastructure (`33f10eb`, `4692bce`+`d26d736`, `068ef84`);
  implementation reverted via `git checkout 068ef84 --
  src/inference/model-inference.ts smoke-test/real-model-page.js`.
  **A future revisit at long-decode or prefill-TTFT scope
  could ship FA without touching the bridge.** See
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-26-fa-enable.md` for the
  plan and decision-rule details.
- **Loader / parser refactor (§11):** GGUF streams cleanly
  through the WASM heap; ctxCreate over-allocation fixed.
  Confirmed working at 3.6 GB / 3.95 GB streaming.
- **Dashboard hygiene pass (2026-04-26):** dropped 23 broken-
  era runs and 23 broken-era evals from
  `eval/reports/smoke-runs.db`. Three cohorts purged:
  bug-#28 q3km gibberish (3+3); pre-`9156deb` (Apr-25 16:19Z)
  realistic-sampler ½-speed JS slow path (qwen3-0.6b ×6 +
  llama-3.2-1b ×3 = 9 profile runs ×2 phases = 18+18); pre-
  `38e41c4` (Apr-26 03:50Z) qwen2 missing attention biases
  (qwen2.5-1.5b ×1 = 2+2). Repopulated dashboard by re-running
  11 profiles under the post-fix pipeline (qwen3-0.6b cold/
  warm/hot × off+thinking, llama-3.2-1b cold/warm/hot,
  tinyllama-warm, qwen2.5-1.5b-warm) — all 22 phases passed,
  output coherent. **bench-profile harness numbers run ~70%
  of `perf.ts` smoke-bench steady-state** (TinyLlama 73.6 vs
  105 perf.ts; qwen3-0.6b-warm 62 vs 85; qwen2.5-1.5b 42 vs
  84) — known harness-overhead gap, not a regression. Use
  `perf.ts` for engine-throughput claims; bench-profile for
  cross-task accuracy + dashboard. **TinyLlama 35% accuracy
  is real model weakness** (1.1B base-class generates a
  poem when asked for a joke), not broken pipeline. dashboard
  reload required to see the cleanup (live-server SSE doesn't
  broadcast deletes).

Driver, K+1 verify, AdaptiveGate, contract gate, creative-low-alpha fixture, `--draft-length` flag, `forwardVerifyArgmax`, and ~30 unit/integration tests retained on side branch as resurrection-ready infra; **do not merge to `main`**. Resurrection paths: (a) much larger target via MEMORY64 shifts target/drafter ratio from 13× to 100×+, (b) faster K+1 verify via 7B+ long-prefill graph-buffer work cuts per-step verify cost. Measurement detail in side-branch TODO §22-§24; tip `646320c`.
§D. ~~Encoder/embedding perf pass.~~ **CLOSED 2026-04-27 — §21** (L1 ctx/graph reuse measured + reverted; Phase 2.5 diagnostic surfaced 95.6% graphCompute share = ~390 dispatches × ~80 µs each → encoder is dispatch-bound, not memory- or compute-bound at this scale; L2/L3-sequential project to <5% combined; only viable lever — concat-graph batched compute — is a non-goal in §D and deferred until a real batch-encoder-throughput use-case emerges). Harness (`eval/embed-perf.ts` + `?embedPerf=…` smoke URL params + `make embed-perf{,-baseline}`) shipped to main; cosine baseline pinned at 0.76 ±0.005 (`tests/encoder-cosine-parity.test.ts`).
§22. ~~7B+ long-prefill graph-buffer tiling.~~ **CLOSED 2026-04-27 — see Completed §22.** Ship-gated default-off; tile=128 unblocks Mistral-7B-Q4_K_S (33.6 tok/s) and Qwen3-8B-IQ3_M (16.2 tok/s) at prefill-512, both within noise of §18 baselines. TinyLlama tile=128 regresses TTFT +81.3% (extra graph dispatches for single-graph-fit models), so the gate stays default-off. Opt in via `?prefillTile=N` (smoke) or `--prefill-tile <n>` (`eval/perf.ts`); ctor option `prefillTileSize` on `ModelInference`. Phase 0 disproved §20's GPU-cap hypothesis: actual abort is the host-side ggml graph allocator at `ggml-alloc.c:82` (not the WebGPU buffer-binding cap). Branch `feat/prefill-tiling-22` (default-off plumbing only — no `recommendedPrefillTile` registry metadata yet; deferred per ship-gated scope). Raw matrix at `eval/reports/prefill-tiling-2026-04-27/SUMMARY.md`.
§27. ~~llama.cpp rebase + free-win sweep.~~ **LANDED 2026-04-27 — §27.** Rebased `webllm-browser-patches` `78433f606 → 434b2a1ff` (zero conflicts, all 11 patches replayed). Bench sweep on 6 models found **+70-80% free win on IQ3_M** (qwen3-8b-iq3m 15.1 → 27.2 tok/s; llama-3.1-8b-iq3m 16.8 → 29.0) from upstream's #22344 fast i-quant mat-vec kernels. Other quants +4-6%. Profile-mode rebench: matmul **48.04 → 23.07 ms** (-52%), dispatch count unchanged (805/token). §16's 16.2 tok/s baseline for `qwen3-8b-iq3m` is obsolete — canonical bench-inf is now **27.2 tok/s**. Commits `db50d28` / `ccf2abb` / `7402e4b`.
§28. ~~§C-v2-A re-measurement post-§27 rebase.~~ **CLOSED 2026-04-28 on side branch `feat/spec-decode-v2-greedy` tip `9bdd707`** — gates **worsened**, not improved (gate 1: 0.42×→0.34×; gate 2: 0.54×→0.45×). Target baseline scaled +78% (15.8→28.2 tok/s) but drafted path only +45-49% — drafter qwen3-0.6b is Q8_0 (not i-quant), retains pre-rebase cost; only K+1=5 verify benefits, amortized across 5 tokens. §26 path (a) "faster K+1 verify" is now **empirically closed**. TODO ref `d10971b` on main; raw matrix at `eval/reports/spec-decode-v2-tile128-postrebase-2026-04-28/SUMMARY.md` on side branch.
§29. ~~§C-v2-A path (c) "smaller i-quant drafter".~~ **CLOSED 2026-04-28 by direct verify-cost probe on side branch tip `4e11d79`.** §28 opened path (c) as a new theoretical resurrection candidate. Probe directly measured `forwardVerifyArgmax` cost on the §28 cell-3 workload: verify is **210 ms/call** (median, p10=207, p90=213) over 27 unique calls — 5.9× a solo-decode step (35.5 ms) — driven by nTokens=5 mat-mat falling outside #22344's fast i-quant *mat-vec* kernels (matmul 187 ms = 90% of compute; dispatch count 796 vs solo 805 = identical graph topology). Cycle decomposition: 27 verify cycles × 210 ms = 5670 ms of 6842 ms wall (83% of cycle); drafter+overhead = 43 ms/cycle ≈ K=4 × 11 ms/forward. **Counterfactual drafter→0:** cycle = 210 ms / 2.37 tok = 11.3 tok/s = 0.40× the 28.2 tok/s baseline, fails both gates by 3.8× / 0.6×. Path (c) cannot close the gates regardless of drafter cost. Path (b) MEMORY64 → 70B+ target is the only remaining theoretical v2-A path. Probe cost: 1 profile run + 1 agentchrome js-exec ≈ 2 min wall. Saved: multi-day model acquisition campaign. Side branch tip `4e11d79`; report at `eval/reports/spec-decode-v2-tile128-postrebase-2026-04-28/VERIFY-COST-PROBE.md` on side branch.
§30. ~~Heuristic-based prefill-tile default in `ModelInference`.~~ **CLOSED 2026-04-28 — refactor landed on `main`.** Replaced §23's dual-source-of-truth pattern (`recommendedPrefillTile` field on `BenchmarkModel` + mirrored `RECOMMENDED_PREFILL_TILE` map in `smoke-test/real-model-page.js`) with `computeDefaultPrefillTileSize(hp)` exported from `src/inference/model-inference.ts`. Rule: `layerCount >= 32 AND embeddingLength >= 4096` → 128, else 0. Maps directly to the §22 abort signature ("32 layers × seq=512 of F32 intermediates"). Pre-edit Phase 0 probe validated all 18 downloaded registered models classify identically to the prior registry. Tile pill in the smoke page now renders post-ctor from `inference.prefillTileSize` so the auto-default is visible without page-side duplication. Override surfaces unchanged: `{ prefillTileSize: N }` ctor opt, `?prefillTile=N` URL, `--prefill-tile <n>` CLI all win, including the explicit-zero force-disable path. Browser smoke regression (B.1-B.4 from spec) verified all four overrides + auto-defaults work. Net change: −31 LOC (88 ins / 89 del across 6 files), 427 → 428 tests. Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-28-prefill-tile-heuristic-design.md`. Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-28-prefill-tile-heuristic.md`.
§31. ~~MEMORY64 cap probe.~~ **CLOSED 2026-04-28 — partial result, lever NOT closed.** Probe target `webllm-wasm-mem64` built clean (133K js / 2.28M wasm) under `-sMEMORY64=1 -sWASM_BIGINT=1 -sMAXIMUM_MEMORY=16GB` via `make mem64-probe`; standalone `smoke-test/mem64-probe.html` ran four sequential phases against Chrome 147 + Emscripten 5.0.6 on M4 Max / macOS 26.4.1. **Outcomes:** Phase 1 (ASYNCIFY × MEMORY64 round-trip) **PASS** — `_webgpu_init` 1.4 ms wall, `_webgpu_shutdown` clean. **The single load-bearing risk axis from spec §4.1 is retired.** Phase 2 (BigInt ABI) **FAIL** — asymmetric: custom bridge exports (`_tensor_new_1d`) correctly return `BigInt`, but stdlib `_malloc` returns JS `Number` (`0xac6548` truncated). Phase 3 (cap probe) **invalid** — bailed at iter 0 because `_malloc(1 GiB)` returned a `Number`, indistinguishable from "actually 0" vs "high pointer mangled by JS shim"; no measured cap. Phase 4 (post-probe re-init) **PASS** — runtime stable. **Decision-rule branch (spec §5.1):** "Phase 1 passes, Phase 2 fails — narrower follow-up: investigate the specific ABI failure before committing more surface." Likely fix is a thin C wrapper (`bridge_malloc`/`bridge_free`) so the build emits explicit-signature shims, or a newer Emscripten release. Few-line change. **Probe paid for itself:** surfaced the actual blocker (a config gap, not architectural incompat) in same-day cost. Six commits across CMake / Make / harness / two review-fix rounds: `314f3a3` `e43244d` `2631eb5` `005c522` `e153e92` `53db417` `f3aad4a` plus a sub-probe revert (`b9c0c09`). Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-28-memory64-cap-probe-design.md`. Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-28-memory64-cap-probe.md`. Closure report: `eval/reports/memory64-probe-2026-04-28/SUMMARY.md`.

§32. ~~llama.cpp rebase 2026-04-28-eve + free-win sweep.~~ **CLOSED 2026-04-28 — rebase-clean (after fix-up patch 12), small regression, accepted; new pattern recorded ("no free win, small regression, accepted").** Triggered by upstream `ggml-webgpu` movement (#22456 buffer aliasing refactor for `ssm_scan` landed). Rebased `webllm-browser-patches` `434b2a1ff → f9f33654a` (10 upstream commits, 1 in `ggml-webgpu/`); all 11 patches replayed cleanly via `git rebase --onto`, but compile error surfaced in patch 3 because #22456 renamed `webgpu_tensor_offset` → `ggml_webgpu_tensor_offset` and folded `view_offs` into the helper body. **Resolved by adding patch 12 as a forward fix-up** (single-line rename + drop redundant `view_offs`; bit-identical post-rename behavior; **squashed back into patch 3 on 2026-04-28 post-§31b cleanup pass** — patch stack now 11 patches again, WASM byte-identical pre/post squash, safety branch `webllm-browser-patches-pre-squash-2026-04-28` retained at `c4af89356`). Build gotcha encountered + documented: stale `src/wasm/build/CMakeCache.txt` carries `MATH_LIBRARY=NOTFOUND` from the pre-revert ggml CMake which the post-revert `if (DEFINED MATH_LIBRARY)` then incorrectly trips — **always nuke `src/wasm/build/` before a build that crosses upstream `d530d6e7a`**. WASM build clean post-fix (2,249,650 bytes, +9 KB from #22456 refactor); checkall 428/11/0; smoke clean. **Sweep result (vs §27 post-rebase baselines):** tinyllama-q4_0 110.8→107.4 (-3.1%), qwen3-0.6b 89.8→86.9 (-3.2%), qwen3-1.7b 62.2→60.9 (-2.1%), mistral-7b-q4ks 35.8→35.0 (-2.2%, 5-run), **llama-3.1-8b-iq3m 29.0→27.2 (-6.2%, 5-run)**, qwen3-8b-iq3m 27.2→26.2 (-3.7%). 5 of 6 within ±5% noise band; llama-3.1-8b-iq3m holds a real ~6% regression at 5 runs. **Likely cause:** #22456's aliasing-logic refactor interacting with tied-embedding + GQA + IQ3_M kernels (qwen3-8b-iq3m has identical GQA shape but untied embeddings and is essentially flat; the buffer-aliasing path is exercised more heavily by tied weights). Profile-mode rebench queued as optional follow-up but not done — 6% on a single non-canonical-baseline model fits the §27 doctrine "document and move on, unless a free win opens." **Decision: accept the rebase as new baseline.** Reverting costs ~6% on llama-3.1-8b-iq3m but loses upstream's option value for the next ggml-webgpu kernel cycle (Vulkan tuning + #22296 backend dedup landed here as setup work). Cherry-picking around #22456 specifically would diverge further from upstream and increase per-rebase maintenance. **Updates to canonical baselines:** `llama-3.1-8b-iq3m` 29.0 → 27.2 tok/s. Other 5 unchanged within noise. Closure report: `eval/reports/llama-cpp-rebase-2026-04-28-eve/SUMMARY.md`. Patch doc updated: `docs/LLAMA_CPP_PATCHES.md` (new patch 12 entry + 2026-04-28-eve rebase narrative + cache-staleness gotcha). Safety branch `webllm-browser-patches-pre-rebase-2026-04-28-eve` preserves pre-rebase tip `981859864`. **§32 is the first "small regression, accepted" close** in the rebase-trigger pattern; future rebases follow §27 ("free win") or §28 ("negative result, lever closed harder") or §32 ("rebase-clean, small regression, accepted") templates depending on outcome.

§31a. ~~MEMORY64 cap probe — bridge_malloc sub-probe.~~ **CLOSED 2026-04-28 — lever now VIABLE; ready for full bridge migration scoping.** Direct execution of §31's spec §6 follow-up: added thin C wrappers `bridge_malloc(size_t) → void*` and `bridge_free(void*)` to `src/wasm/webgpu-bridge.cpp`, exported `_bridge_malloc,_bridge_free` from `src/wasm/CMakeLists.txt`, and swapped Phase 2 + Phase 3 of `smoke-test/mem64-probe.html` to use them. Re-ran probe: **all four phases PASS.** Phase 2 — `_bridge_malloc(16n) → typeof=bigint value=0xac6548` with byte-equal F32 round-trip; stdlib `_malloc` diagnostic confirms the §31 asymmetry persists in the same build (`typeof=number`), so the wrapper is the targeted fix not a stdlib upgrade. Phase 3 — sequential 1 GiB allocations succeeded for **15 iterations × 1 GiB = 16,106,127,360 bytes ≈ 15.00 GiB** with 64 KiB page-commit per allocation; iter 15 hit BigInt `0n` (allocator out of headroom under the configured `-sMAXIMUM_MEMORY=16GB`). All 15 freed cleanly via `_bridge_free`. **Decision-rule branch (parent spec §5.1): "≥8 GiB → promote to full bridge migration."** 15 GiB covers every model size that fits the 2026-04-28 30B project ceiling: 8B Q4_K_S (~4.5 GiB weights), 13B Q4_K_S (~7.4 GiB), 30B IQ3_M (~12.8 GiB; tight against 15 GiB once KV+activations land — `MAXIMUM_MEMORY` bump may be needed). **Cap is configured-ceiling-bound, not hardware-bound** — actual Chrome wasm64 upper bound is presumably higher; raise `MAXIMUM_MEMORY` only if the 30B working set demands it. Net code change: **+18 LOC** across 3 files. Probe wall-clock: 19 ms. Implementation took ~5 minutes; build ~30 seconds (incremental). **§31a does NOT migrate the production `webllm-wasm` build to MEMORY64** — that is the P2-class follow-up spec, scoped at: (i) replace stdlib malloc/free call sites in `src/inference/` + `src/wasm/` TS code, (ii) audit `int32_t size`/offset params in `webgpu-bridge.cpp` for >2 GiB transfer signatures, (iii) update GGUF loader to keep BigInt offsets across JS↔WASM, (iv) re-run smoke + bench-inf + bench-profile gates under MEMORY64 to confirm zero regression on the existing ≤4 GiB fleet, (v) decide single-binary vs dual-binary deploy. Open as a separate spec/plan cycle when a 13B or 30B target is asked for. Closure report: `eval/reports/memory64-probe-2026-04-28/SUMMARY-31a.md`.

D. **Bump `MAXIMUM_MEMORY` (deferred §12, dropped in
   priority).** Confirmed in earlier sessions that 4 GiB
   is the 32-bit WASM hard cap. Going beyond requires
   `-sMEMORY64=1` (changes pointer types throughout the
   bridge, possible asyncify interactions). Multi-day
   engineering. Only worth it for wave-3 12B+ candidates
   that need Q4_K_S+. **Updated 2026-04-28 by §31:** probe
   built `webllm-wasm-mem64` and ran end-to-end same-day,
   retired the asyncify-incompat risk axis, and surfaced a
   targeted BigInt-ABI gap on stdlib `_malloc` (not the
   multi-day rewrite originally feared). Lever **not
   closed**; follow-up is a few-line `bridge_malloc` wrapper
   then re-run the cap probe. See §31 entry below for the
   full closure narrative.

E. **Remaining deferred items (in rough priority):**
   - **7B+ long-prefill graph-buffer infrastructure**
     *(blocking the §4 hypothesis at scale — see §20).*
     Mistral-7B and both 8B candidates abort at
     `backend_alloc_ctx_tensors` when building long-prefill
     graphs (32 layers × seq=512 of F32 intermediates exceeds
     WebGPU max-buffer-binding cap), independent of FA mode.
     Bumping the `graphMem` allocator did not help; the abort
     is GPU-side. Without this, FA wins at prefill / long-
     decode at the canonical 4-baseline cannot be measured.
   - **§4 FA revisit at long-decode / prefill-TTFT scope**
     **CLOSED 2026-04-26 at §20** — TinyLlama wins everywhere,
     Mistral short-short -3.3% over gate, 7B+ long-prefill
     blocked by the buffer-binding limit above. Gate retained
     in tree (default-off `flashAttn` constructor option +
     `?fa=on` smoke param + `--fa <on|off>` perf.ts flag);
     no further work until the infra item above unblocks the
     measurement.
   - **§B FA shape-routing** for prefill/TTFT — same
     `flash_attn_get_decisions` code path; blocked on the
     7B+ buffer-binding infra item above.
   - **§D encoder/embedding perf pass.** **CLOSED 2026-04-27 — §21.**
     Single-text levers exhausted (L1 reverted; L2/L3-sequential <5%
     combined headroom). The only structural lever is concat-graph
     batched compute (was §D non-goal); reopen if a batch-encoder-
     throughput use-case emerges. Harness (`eval/embed-perf.ts` +
     smoke `?embedPerf=…`) and cosine pin (0.76 ±0.005) shipped.
   - **§C v2-A greedy spec-decode + GPU-resident verify.**
     **CLOSED 2026-04-27 on side branch
     `feat/spec-decode-v2-greedy`** — measured-and-closed
     pattern. Eliminates v1's 2.4 MB / step readback via
     `forwardVerifyArgmax` (16 B / step), but at qwen3-8b-
     iq3m × qwen3-0.6b-q4f16 K=4 still fails both ship gates
     (0.36× high-α speedup; 0.78× low-α safety). Per-step
     drafter forwards (~48 ms) + target K+1 verify (~70-80
     ms) ≈ 120 ms; even at perfect K=4 accept that's only
     ~33 tok/s vs 16 tok/s baseline (~2×, tight at 1.5× spec
     gate even at α=1). Measured α ≈ 0.2-0.25 inverts the
     trade. Driver, AdaptiveGate, contract gate, K+1 verify,
     ~30 tests, and tooling all retained on side branch.
     Resurrection only worth it if (i) a much larger target
     lands (70B+ via MEMORY64 → target/drafter ratio 100×+),
     or (ii) faster K+1 verify via 7B+ long-prefill graph-
     buffer work below cuts per-step verify cost.
   - **Deferred wave-1 architectures** (Gemma 2, Phi 3) —
     5+ gaps for Gemma; mostly fused-QKV for Phi 3. See
     "Completed on 2026-04-26" §9.

**Net characterization at 8B IQ3_M (post-§27 rebase,
both families):** matmul ≈ **55%** of decode on `qwen3-8b-iq3m`
(was §16's 65-69% pre-rebase; #22344 cut matmul ms ~52%
without changing dispatch count, dropping share by 15.5 pp).
Encode overhead is now the secondary suspect at ~10.7%;
attention is negligible (1.7%). bench-inf canonical: **27.2
tok/s** on qwen3-8b-iq3m, **29.0 tok/s** on llama-3.1-8b-iq3m
(both up +70-80% from §17's pre-rebase baselines). **All
single-token decode kernel-tuning AND algorithmic-amortization
levers — including greedy spec-decode with GPU-resident verify
even after the §27 target speedup — are now closed without
ship.** §17 ruled out matmul-kernel rework (§A); §18
ruled out FA fusion at N=1 decode; §19 ruled out drafter
speculative decoding at K=4 with full-row verify (verify-
readback dominates); §20 ruled out FA at small-prefill /
long-decode scale on the 7B+ fleet (TinyLlama wins preserved
behind a default-off gate; 7B+ blocked by WebGPU max-buffer-
binding limit at long-prefill); §C-v2-A (side branch, 2026-04-27)
ruled out greedy spec with GPU-resident K+1 verify at the
canonical target/drafter ratio (per-step verify overhead caps
α below the K=4 break-even ceiling); §21 closed §D on a
diagnostic finding (encoder embed is dispatch-bound, single-text
levers <5% headroom; only structural lever — concat-graph batched
compute — is a non-goal until a use-case emerges); §26 ruled
out §C-v2-A resurrection under §22 tile=128 (gates 0.42× / 0.54×;
verify graph never splits at K+1=5); §27 picked up upstream's
free-win i-quant kernel speedup (#22344, +70-80% on IQ3_M);
**§28 ruled out §C-v2-A resurrection under §27's faster target
(gates *worsened* to 0.34× / 0.45× — drafter Q8 doesn't benefit
from #22344, only target verify does, so the relative ratio
moved against the thresholds); §29 ruled out §C-v2-A path (c)
"smaller i-quant drafter" by direct verify-cost probe — verify
is 210 ms/call (83% of cycle), so the drafter→0 ceiling is
0.40× the target solo baseline regardless of drafter cost.**
**All algorithmic levers at the canonical 4-baseline are now
exhausted.** Remaining headroom is **architectural
infrastructure**: MEMORY64 to bring 70B+ targets into reach
(multi-day, conditional on a deployment ask; only remaining
v2-A resurrection path with measurable headroom — would shift
the target/drafter ratio from 13× to ~100×); upstream
ggml-webgpu mat-mat fast-path kernels OR dispatch coalescing
(would attack the verify cost wall directly — re-run §27 sweep
+ §28 harness + §29 probe on every llama.cpp rebase to spot the
next free win); §D's deferred concat-graph lever
(encoder-side fallback if a batch-throughput use-case appears).

Boot sequence for a fresh session:

1. **`make checkall`** — confirm 428 pass / 11 skip / 0 fail.
   The §C drafter spec-decoding work added 19 unit + integration
   tests across `tests/sampler.test.ts` (7), `tests/speculative-
   rejection.test.ts` (11), `tests/forward-verify-equivalence.test.ts`
   (Bun-skipped, +6 more), `tests/speculative-integration.test.ts`
   (Bun-skipped, 3), and 1 engagement-gate test. The §20 FA-revisit
   work added 5 tests at `tests/fa-mode-config.test.ts` (413 → 418).
   The §21 §D cycle added 1 test at `tests/encoder-cosine-parity.test.ts`
   (418 → 419). The §22 prefill-tile cycle added 5 unit tests at
   `tests/prefill-tiling-config.test.ts` plus 1 Bun-skipped equivalence
   stub at `tests/prefill-tiling-equivalence.test.ts` (419 → 424;
   skip count 10 → 11). The §23 default-on auto-tile cycle added 2
   registry-shape tests in `tests/eval-models.test.ts` (424 → 426).
   The §24 §4 FA revisit at 7B+ long-prefill cycle added 0 tests
   (closure C — measurement campaign + closure writeup; zero `src/`
   change). **§25 dashboard hygiene + new viz cycle added 1 test**
   (`tests/live-server.test.ts` gained a `/models` endpoint contract
   test pinning shape, sort order, and architecture+paramsB
   coverage; 426 → 427 pass). **§26 / §27 / §28 / §29 added 0 tests**
   each — §26 was a measurement+closure cycle (side-branch matrix +
   3 docs commits on main); §27 was a llama.cpp rebase + bench
   sweep (3 docs commits); §28 was a side-branch re-measurement
   (1 docs commit on main, side branch tip `9bdd707`); §29 was a
   side-branch verify-cost probe (1 docs commit on main, side
   branch tip `4e11d79`). **§30 was a refactor (registry → ctor
   heuristic): net +1 test** — added 3 boundary tests in
   `tests/prefill-tiling-config.test.ts` (5 → 8) and deleted 2
   registry-shape tests in `tests/eval-models.test.ts` (the
   `recommendedPrefillTile auto-default` describe block); 427 →
   428 pass. The WebGPU-gated integration tests skip under Bun
   (no `navigator.gpu`).
2. **`git log --oneline -30`** — top of `main` is the §30
   prefill-tile heuristic refactor (`88b74f9 refactor(prefill-tile):
   replace dual-registry pattern with hyperparam heuristic`).
   This is the FIRST `src/`-touching commit since §23 (`0c50e03`,
   2026-04-27): all of §24-§29 were measurement-only / docs-only.
   §30 deletes `recommendedPrefillTile` from `eval/models.ts`,
   the smoke mirror map from `smoke-test/real-model-page.js`,
   and the registry fallback from `eval/perf.ts`; adds
   `computeDefaultPrefillTileSize` to `src/inference/model-inference.ts`.
   Below `88b74f9`: `3a58949 docs(plan): prefill-tile heuristic
   refactor — phased implementation plan` and `ae68bbe docs(spec):
   prefill-tile heuristic — replace dual-registry pattern` are
   the §30 spec + plan commits. Below those: `cf6dd4a docs(TODO):
   §29 — §C-v2-A path (c) closed by verify-cost probe` was the §29
   main commit (verify-cost probe writeup landed on
   `feat/spec-decode-v2-greedy` side branch tip `4e11d79`, which
   is **archived — do not merge**). Below it: `a7633c4
   docs(TODO): refresh resumption checklist post-§27 rebase
   + §28 closure` was the §28 main commit. Below that the §28
   measurement: `d10971b docs(perf): §28 §C-v2-A re-measurement
   — gates worsened, lever closed harder`. Below it the §27

   + matmul tuning)`. Below those: `391ea29 docs(TODO): split
   into TODO.md (active) + TODO_ARCHIVE.md (historical)` is the
   TODO_ARCHIVE split that landed between §26 and §27. Below
   that, the §26 cycle (3 commits): `01b66fe docs(TODO): refresh
   resumption checklist post-§26 closure` → `e715160 docs(TODO):

   `85988c8 docs(TODO): §24 — §4 FA revisit at 7B+ long-prefill
   MEASURED + CLOSED` is the §24 closure (single docs/measurement
   commit, zero `src/` change). Below §24: §23
   (§22 default-on auto-tile via `recommendedPrefillTile`) landed
   on `main` on 2026-04-27 as a single commit `0c50e03 feat(eval):
   §22 default-on auto-tile via recommendedPrefillTile`. Below it:
   `1b15f37 docs(TODO): refresh resumption checklist post-§22 merge`.
   Then the §22 fast-forward merge from 2026-04-27: `a73ad88
   docs(TODO): §22 — prefill-tile chunking SHIP GATED`. Below it
   the §22 implementation: `5b5705a` (Task 5 matrix),
   `18e1677` (Task 4 perf flag), `2fcc334` (Task 3 smoke wiring),
   `f281ac3` (Task 2 equivalence stub), `c38fb8f` (Task 1 ctor option
   + dispatcher), `8e21036` (Task 0 Phase 0 diagnostic). Below those:
   `b8eebf8` (post-§21 resumption refresh), `b6a288c docs: generalize
   DOCUMENTATION_STYLE_GUIDE.md`. The §21 block: `5e24913` (§21 §D
   closure), `66bc603` (§D Phase 2.5 diagnostic), `3a6a366` (revert L1
   same-graph-cache — gate failed), `f0d89f1` (Phase 2 L1 measurements),
   `5eb1f73` (L1 implementation, reverted), `c24c628` (Phase 2
   choice spec), `a92ca7e` (Phase 1 baseline), `4c237a3`
   (cosine parity test), `582a3ba` (embed-perf Make targets),
   `d51d2c5` (embed-perf harness CLI), `3315a88` (smoke-page
   embedPerf hook), `4944209` (embed-prompts fixtures),
   `670ba2e` (§D plan), `092248e` (§D design spec),
   `a36ef48` (cosine baseline JSON). Before that:
   `b872b5f docs(TODO): §20 — §4 FA revisit measured + CLOSED`,
   then the §20
   implementation commits: `f1b19ab` (long-prompt fixtures
   + perf.ts flags), `ddc6e39` (smoke `?fa=on` + F16 KV
   fix), `faccb8e` (gated FA in `forwardDecode` /
   `forwardVerify` / `debugLayerOutput`), `4bfa6f4` (gated
   FA in `forward()`), `4138232` (F16 mask),
   `91d8e26` (flashAttn ctor option + dual V-cache).
   Below those: `a3df85d` (post-§19 next-step refresh),
   `9984fa4` (§19 docs), `aac7080` (engine spec-decode
   revert), `1b23ca8` (drafter handle-id fix). Below those
   the §19 implementation commits (`bbd1dff` smoke-page +
   Makefile, `1b6fd72`+`81e3df0` engine routing, `1c2db1b`
   integration test, `87e732a`+`5572bd4`+`efa094c`+

   sampler helpers, `3fdd347`+`433252b` model-inference
   primitives) — all retained except the engine routing
   block. Below those: `d680371`/`ffd7276` (§18 §4 FA
   closure), `068ef84`/`d26d736`/`4692bce`/`33f10eb`
   (FA infrastructure that survived), then `bebed0c` (§17
   §A closure) and `c98d0a7` (§16 qwen3-8b register).
   The merged branch `feat/prefill-tiling-22` was already
   deleted at merge time. The §20-era `feat/fa-revisit-prefill-
   long-decode` is also already merged; if it's still in your
   local checkout, `git branch -d` is safe (it points at
   `b872b5f` already on `main`).
3. **`git -C ~/Repos/llama.cpp log --oneline -12 webllm-browser-patches`**
   — confirm the **11-patch stack** is intact (was 12 between §32
   and the post-§31b cleanup; patch 12 squashed back into patch 3
   2026-04-28) and the base is upstream `f9f33654a vulkan: Coalesce
   Q4_K/Q5_K scale loads (#21751)` (rebased 2026-04-28-eve via §32).
   Tip is `3b8ade2a2 ggml-webgpu: fix UB shift-by-32 in
   load_u32_at_src{,0} for aligned offsets` (patch 11, bug #28 UB
   shift fix; SHA shifted from `ab09f14eb` by the squash since
   patch 3's content changed and downstream cherry-picks re-hash).
   Patch 3 (`d10d41a13 ggml-webgpu: add request-based browser
   readback API`) now incorporates the #22456 helper rename
   directly (`ggml_webgpu_tensor_offset(tensor) + offset`) — no
   separate fix-up commit. Safety branches:
   `webllm-browser-patches-pre-squash-2026-04-28` (pre-squash tip
   `c4af89356`), `webllm-browser-patches-pre-rebase-2026-04-28-eve`
   (pre-§32 tip `981859864`), `pre-rebase-2026-04-27` (pre-§27 tip
   `a536df4f4`) — all kept as roll-back targets. The 2026-04-27 →
   2026-04-28-eve delta was 10 upstream commits, 1 of them in
   `ggml-webgpu/` (#22456 buffer aliasing refactor for ssm_scan;
   renamed `webgpu_tensor_offset` helper, folded `view_offs` into
   the helper body). **Zero `git rebase` conflicts**; the compile
   error in patch 3 was a semantic conflict that the §32 rebase
   first resolved via forward-fix-up patch 12 and the post-§31b
   cleanup pass folded back into patch 3 itself. **§17 through
   §31a added zero patches**; **§32 added patch 12** which the
   post-§31b cleanup folded into patch 3 (net stack delta: zero
   patch additions across §17-§31b). The `__EMSCRIPTEN__` guard
   around FA was already removed in the 2026-04-25 rebase; §20
   re-uses the bridge wrappers from §18 with no new shader work;
   §21-§23 + §30 are pure-TS / pure-JS work above the bridge
   with no shader changes.
4. **WASM build state.** `smoke-test/webllm-bundle.js` mtime
   is 2026-04-28 ~10:50 (post-§31b squash rebuild against
   squashed llama.cpp tip `3b8ade2a2`); size is 189574 bytes
   (unchanged since §30 — §32 and the §31b-postlude squash were
   llama.cpp-only). `smoke-test/webllm-wasm.{js,wasm}` mtimes
   are 2026-04-28 ~10:50; `webllm-wasm.wasm` is **2249650 bytes**
   (byte-identical to the pre-squash artifact, confirming the
   squash was semantically a no-op; was 2240603 pre-§32 — +9 KB
   from upstream's #22456 aliasing refactor; was 2207801 pre-§27
   — +42 KB cumulative since the §27 rebase from new Q1_0 +
   i-quant kernels + aliasing refactor). Built against the
   squashed §32 rebased llama.cpp base `f9f33654a`. **`MATH_LIBRARY=NOTFOUND` cache-staleness gotcha**
   from the §32 rebase: upstream's `d530d6e7a` revert tripped the
   stale `find_library` result in the build cache; **always nuke
   `src/wasm/build/` before a build that crosses this commit**
   (or any future find_library-touching upstream change). If the
   artifacts look stale, run: `rm -rf src/wasm/build && source
   ~/emsdk/emsdk_env.sh && make wasm-build && bun build
   src/index.ts --outfile smoke-test/webllm-bundle.js --target
   browser && cp src/wasm/build/webllm-wasm.{js,wasm} smoke-test/
   && make smoke-restart`. **Updated post-§32 sanity baselines
   (`bun run eval/perf.ts --model <m> --runs 3`):** tinyllama-q4_0
   ~107 tok/s, qwen3-0.6b ~87, qwen3-1.7b ~61, mistral-7b-q4ks
   ~35, llama-3.1-8b-iq3m ~27 (was 29.0 pre-§32 — see §32 closure
   for the regression analysis), qwen3-8b-iq3m ~26. Other quick
   smoke confirmations: `model=mistral-7b-instruct-v0.3-q3km` →
   Q3_K_M coherent at ≥20 tok/s (patch 11 / bug #28 fix healthy);
   `model=mistral-7b-instruct-v0.3-q4ks` *with no `?prefillTile=`
   param* → mode bar shows the `tile: 128` pill and prefill
   completes (§22+§23 auto-default healthy); appending
   `&prefillTile=0` to the same URL → pill disappears
   and prefill aborts with the §22 ggml-alloc signature
   (override path healthy).
5. **Read for context:** §17 (§A closure), §18 (§4 FA
   closure at N=1 decode), §19 (§C drafter spec-decode
   closure), §20 (§4 FA revisit at prefill / long-decode
   scope closure), §21 (§D encoder perf cycle — diagnostic
   close, no ship), §22 (7B+ long-prefill graph-buffer
   tiling — gated ship, default-off), §23 (§22 default-on
   flip via `recommendedPrefillTile` registry field — landed
   2026-04-27 as a single commit, `0c50e03`), §27 (llama.cpp
   rebase + free-win sweep — IQ3_M +70-80% from upstream
   #22344, the pattern to repeat after every llama.cpp
   rebase), and §28 (§C-v2-A re-measurement post-rebase —
   negative result with cleaner gates, the template for
   re-measuring closed levers when upstream perf shifts).
   The first six follow the "measure-and-close" pattern;
   §23 is a thin policy-layer follow-on with no measurement
   campaign; §27 is the template for **rebase-driven
   opportunistic measurement**; §28 is the template for
   **re-running closed gates when their underlying
   assumptions move** (sometimes the answer worsens — that
   is itself a useful close).
   §22 is the cleanest recent template for **gated-ship**:
   opt-in plumbing threaded through ctor / URL param / CLI
   flag, default-off keeps the fast-path bit-identical,
   decision rule cited matrix numbers — see
   `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-27-prefill-tiling.md` and
   `eval/reports/prefill-tiling-2026-04-27/SUMMARY.md`.
   §23 is the cleanest template for **promoting an opt-in
   gate to default-on without a new measurement** when the
   gating decision can be expressed as registry data. §21 remains the cleanest template
   for **closing on a diagnostic finding** when the bottleneck
   profile invalidates the planned levers — see
   `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-27-encoder-perf-pass-design.md`
   (Phase 2.5 addendum) and
   `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-27-encoder-perf-pass.md`.
   The §20 plan
   at `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-26-fa-revisit-long-
   decode.md` and the matrix raw logs at
   `eval/reports/fa-revisit-2026-04-27/` carry the FA
   gate's full contract: F16 K + F16 V cache when
   `flashAttn=true` (else legacy F32 K + dim-swapped V),
   F16 causal mask in all four branches, dual V-write
   layouts in `forward` / `forwardVerify` / `forwardDecode`
   / `debugLayerOutput`. The §C plan at
   `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-26-speculative-
   decoding.md` and design at `docs/superpowers/specs/
   2026-04-26-speculative-decoding-design.md` are the
   reference for the v2 lever — driver code at
   `src/inference/speculative.ts` is wired up and tested;
   only the engine dispatch needs unblocking.
6. **Dashboard state check** (optional but useful before
   benching): `sqlite3 eval/reports/smoke-runs.db "SELECT
   COUNT(*) FROM runs; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM evals;"` —
   should return **29 runs / 30 evals** (unchanged through
   §17/§18/§19/§20/§21/§22/§23/§24/§26/§27/§28/§29/§30 — none of the
   ten closures produced new dashboard data, only TODO
   writeups, perf.ts logs, §22's
   `eval/reports/prefill-tiling-2026-04-27/` matrix, §26's
   `eval/reports/spec-decode-v2-tile128-2026-04-27/` matrix
   on the side branch, and §28's
   `eval/reports/spec-decode-v2-tile128-postrebase-2026-04-28/`
   matrix on the side branch). **Note:** the dashboard's
   numbers for `qwen3-8b-iq3m` are pre-§27 (16.2 tok/s);
   they will be stale until a new bench-profile run for that
   model is saved into `smoke-runs.db`. If a fresh session
   wants to refresh the 8B numbers in the dashboard, run
   `make bench-profile PROFILES=qwen3-8b-warm` (and the
   thinking variant) and the SSE feed will repopulate.
   The live dashboard SSE counter
   shows higher numbers (~52/53) because it accumulates
   streaming events without DB persistence; both views are
   correct but independent. If the dashboard tab is open
   from a prior session, force-reload — SSE doesn't
   broadcast deletes.
7. **Bridge wrappers retained from §18, now used by §20.**
   `op_flash_attn_ext`, `op_flash_attn_ext_set_prec`,
   `op_flash_attn_ext_add_sinks` exist in
   `src/wasm/webgpu-bridge.cpp` and are exported in
   `src/wasm/CMakeLists.txt`. `opFlashAttn`,
   `opFlashAttnSetPrec`, `opFlashAttnAddSinks` exist on
   the `GgmlWasm` class in `src/inference/ggml-wasm.ts`.
   §20 wired call sites into `model-inference.ts` behind
   `flashAttn=true`; the wrappers are now live (not dead)
   when the gate is enabled. **Do not delete them.**

   **§26+§28+§29 side-branch state** (no impact on `main`): the
   `feat/spec-decode-v2-greedy` branch carries the entire v2-A
   driver, AdaptiveGate, K+1 verify, contract gate, and ~30
   unit/integration tests, plus the four cherry-picked §22
   commits, §26's matrix evidence, §28's post-rebase
   re-measurement, and §29's verify-cost probe writeup. Tip is
   now **`4e11d79`** (was `9bdd707` at §28 close, `6b20aad` at
   §26 close). **Do not merge to `main`** — §28 found gates
   *worsened* under the §27 rebase (gate 1 0.42× → 0.34×;
   gate 2 0.54× → 0.45×) because drafter Q8 doesn't benefit
   from #22344, only target verify does; **§29 then ruled out
   the "smaller i-quant drafter" path entirely** by directly
   measuring verify at 210 ms/call (83% of cycle), so even a
   zero-time drafter caps the cell at 0.40× target solo. If a
   future cycle resurrects v2-A, the only path with measurable
   headroom is a 70B+ target via MEMORY64 (target/drafter ratio
   13× → ~100×).
8. **§20 FA gate + §22/§23 prefill-tile gate state (both on `main`).**
   `new ModelInference(wasm, hp)` with no `opts` argument is
   bit-identical to pre-§20/§22 behaviour: FA defaults off,
   `prefillTileSize` defaults to `0` at the ctor. **§23 moves
   the per-model auto-default up one layer** — the
   harness (`eval/perf.ts`) and the smoke page now consult
   `recommendedPrefillTile` (registry side) /
   `RECOMMENDED_PREFILL_TILE` (smoke side) to pick the ctor
   arg automatically. The ctor itself is unchanged.
   - **FA path:** pass `{ flashAttn: true }` to the constructor,
     append `?fa=on` to the smoke-page URL, or pass `--fa on` to
     `eval/perf.ts`. No auto-default — FA stays opt-in.
   - **Prefill-tile path (§22+§23):** auto-applies tile=128 on
     all 7B+ entries (mistral-7b q4ks/q3km/iq4xs, llama-3.1-8b-
     iq3m, qwen3-8b-iq3m). Sub-7B paths get tile=0
     (single-graph fast path). Override surface:
     `?prefillTile=N` (smoke), `--prefill-tile <n>`
     (`eval/perf.ts`), or `{ prefillTileSize: <n> }`
     (`ModelInference` ctor). Force-disable via `0`.
     Adding new 7B+ entries: nothing to do — the §30
     `computeDefaultPrefillTileSize(hp)` heuristic in
     `src/inference/model-inference.ts` derives the default
     from `hyperparams.layerCount × embeddingLength`, so the
     ctor self-configures. If the heuristic is wrong on a
     specific model, override at the call site via
     `{ prefillTileSize: N }` ctor opt, `?prefillTile=N`
     URL, or `--prefill-tile <n>` CLI flag.
   - **`eval/perf.ts`** also accepts
     `--prompt-fixture <prefill-256|prefill-512|prefill-1024>` and
     `--decode-tokens <n>` for the long-prefill / long-decode
     harness; fixtures live in `eval/fixtures/long-prompts.ts`.
   - **Mistral-7B and 8B models** abort at `backend_alloc_ctx_tensors`
     on long-prefill workloads with `prefillTileSize=0` — the
     §22 closure documents the actual failure mechanism (host-side
     ggml graph allocator at `ggml-alloc.c:82`, not the WebGPU
     binding cap as §20 originally hypothesized). Post-§23 the
     auto-default makes this transparent for harness consumers;
     the abort surface only re-emerges if a caller passes
     `?prefillTile=0` / `--prefill-tile 0` explicitly. FA mode
     is orthogonal.

**Status (post-§31b + patch-12-squash):** No perf lever is forced.
The algorithmic levers at the canonical 4-baseline are exhausted
(§17-§29 closed the matmul, FA, drafter, encoder, prefill-tiling,
and spec-decode families). The MEMORY64 ceiling that gated 13B/30B
targets is no longer architecturally blocked (§31 + §31a — 15 GiB
measured; §31b — 16 GiB Emscripten 5.0.6 wasm-ld toolchain ceiling),
but the full bridge migration is gated on deployment ask **and
inherits a 30B-tightness tracking item** (long-context working set
lands within margin of error of the toolchain ceiling — re-probe on
every Emscripten upgrade). §32 ran the upstream rebase + sweep
cycle and accepted a small regression on `llama-3.1-8b-iq3m`.
**§32a (2026-04-28) ran the profile-mode follow-up probe** — H1
"tied-embedding × #22456 aliasing-refactor" rejected (no bucket
asymmetry vs untied Qwen3-8B reference); H2 "uniform per-step
overhead" supported; §32 baseline accepted as final. **Post-§31b
cleanup squashed §32's forward-fix-up patch 12 back into patch 3**;
patch stack 12 → 11; WASM byte-identical (2,249,650 bytes); ship
gate 428/11/0 unchanged. All three opt-in probes from the
post-§32 next-steps list are now closed (§32a / §31b / patch-12
squash). All other open work is conditional on external triggers.

### Active next steps (post-§31b + squash + housekeeping)

**Status:** all three opt-in probes from the post-§32 list closed
2026-04-28 (§32a / §31b / patch-12 squash); **all three fresh
housekeeping items closed 2026-04-28** (#4 dashboard refresh /
#5 pre-rebase baselines / #6 §32 SUMMARY cross-link); **all three
doc-style next-step candidates closed 2026-04-28** (#7 TODO header
pin refresh / #8 BENCHMARKS tier expansion / #9 CLAUDE.md
doctrine capture); **#10 vault-save closed 2026-04-28** (5 notes
landed under `~/ClaudeVault/Patterns/` + `Knowledge/`; index
rebuilt, MANIFESTs verified — see closure entry in Watch list).
**Algorithmic-perf backlog fully cleared.** All algorithmic levers
at the canonical 4-baseline are exhausted (§17-§29 closed matmul,
FA, drafter, encoder, prefill-tiling, spec-decode families).
Upstream cadence check 2026-04-28: no `ggml-webgpu/` movement → no
rebase trigger near firing. Perf next-work is gated entirely on
external triggers (see "External-trigger candidates").

**Embedding-model expansion (2026-04-28).** Bucket A landed
(commit `41b27bd` — bge-small + bge-large registered, both validated
end-to-end via agentchrome smoke). B (non-BERT BERT-derived) and
C (causal-LM-derived) remain queued for triage. See "Embedding-
model expansion candidates" section below.

**Fresh observation pinned 2026-04-28 from #5 data:** the encoder
overhead (`backendEncodeOverheadMs` per step) is a **fixed
per-dispatch cost of ~5.2-5.7 µs**, remarkably flat across the
entire 450 → 805 dispatch/token range:

| Model            | Dispatches | Encoder (median, ms) | µs/dispatch |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| tinyllama-q4_0   | 450 | 2.40 | 5.3 |
| qwen3-0.6b-q8    | 629 | 3.30 | 5.2 |
| qwen3-1.7b-q8    | 629 | 3.60 | 5.7 |
| mistral-7b-q4ks  | 650 | 3.60 | 5.5 |
| llama-3.1-8b-iq3m| 652 | 3.40 | 5.2 |
| qwen3-8b-iq3m    | 805 | 4.40 | 5.5 |

Implication: **encoder share scales inversely with model size
because matmul shrinks at small models, not because encoder
grows.** Encoder is 24-30% at tiny models (TinyLlama, Qwen3-0.6B)
where matmul is 33-38%; drops to 9-11% at 7-8B where matmul is
49-58%. **Reducing the per-dispatch encode cost would yield
~26% relative speedup at TinyLlama scale (11.40 → 9.00 ms/step
→ 87.9 → 111.1 tok/s).** Lever isn't load-bearing for the
project's size-30B target ceiling — at large models the
absolute headroom is <1 tok/s — but is the only real
opportunity at sub-1B targets if a "tiny-model" deployment
appears. Captured as a finding rather than a next step.

### Embedding-model expansion candidates (queued 2026-04-28)

User-driven scope: extend embedding fleet beyond the two registered
Arctic-Embed entries. Three candidate buckets, in increasing scope.
**Bucket A is in progress;** B and C tracked here for triage when A
closes.

**A. Register more BERT-arch embedders** ~~(in progress 2026-04-28)~~
**DONE 2026-04-28** (commit `41b27bd`). Confirmed cleanly: the
encoder forward path, WordPiece tokenizer, F16 / F32 dtypes, and
CLS pooling (read from GGUF metadata) all already work for BGE
out of the box — zero code changes outside `eval/models.ts`,
`eval/smoke-profiles.ts`, `eval/embed-perf.ts`.
- `bge-small-en-v1.5-q0f16` (~33M, 384-dim): 17.0 ms p50 single-
  text short / 91% on 8-task cosine eval. Apples-to-apples with
  arctic-embed-s.
- `bge-large-en-v1.5-q0f16` (~335M, 1024-dim): 59.3 ms p50
  single-text short / 89% on 8-task cosine eval. **First 335M
  encoder in fleet** — new scaling point for the dashboard's
  Embeddings section. 3.5× latency for 10× params consistent
  with bandwidth-bound encoder behavior.

GGUF source: `ChristianAzinn/bge-{small,large}-en-v1.5-gguf` mirror
(same publisher as the arctic-embed entries already in tree).
File-name pattern: `_fp16` (matches `bge-{small,large}-en-v1.5_fp16.gguf`
unique within each repo).

**Net learning:** the BERT-arch lever is effectively free for any
future ask — no loader changes were required. Stretch picks
(`bge-base-en-v1.5`, `mxbai-embed-large-v1`, `snowflake-arctic-
embed-l`) are now register-and-run candidates with high confidence.
Add them only if a specific deployment ask names them, or as part
of B/C closure. Otherwise dispatch B or C next based on what
embedder family the next deployment ask names.

**B. Extend `EncoderInference` to non-BERT arch** (deferred). Two
popular asks both require real engineering on top of A's
infrastructure:
- `nomic-embed-text-v1` — modified BERT with rotary positional
  embeddings instead of absolute. Needs RoPE path in
  `EncoderInference.forward` and arch branch in the loader.
- `jina-embeddings-v2` — ALiBi attention (linear bias). Needs
  ALiBi support in the encoder attention path and a new arch
  identifier.

Scope estimate: 1-2 day equivalents each; reversible (additive,
opt-in). Trigger: a deployment ask explicitly naming one of these
families, OR an MTEB-quality justification beating the BGE
canonical pick that lands under A.

**C. Causal-LM-derived embedders (`Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B`)**
(deferred). Reuses the existing causal forward but requires:
- Embed-mode toggle on `ModelInference` (skip sampling, return
  hidden state)
- Last-token (or attention-pooled) pooling head
- L2 normalize + project to embedding-dim if model has a head

Scope: medium (additive). Trigger: an MTEB top-of-leaderboard ask
for >1B embedders, where Qwen3-Embedding-4B and Qwen3-Embedding-8B
become candidates. Highest upside (Qwen3-Embedding tops MTEB at
0.6B-8B as of 2026); also opens a path to other causal-LM
embedders (`gte-Qwen2-*`, `e5-mistral-*`).

### Fresh next-step candidates (2026-04-28)

Three doc-style candidates surfaced post-housekeeping; **all closed
2026-04-28.** No fresh candidates queued.

7. ~~**TODO.md header pin refresh.**~~ **DONE 2026-04-28** (commit
   `64c5eea`) — header block (lines 19-44 post-edit) replaced
   pre-§27 baselines with post-§32 canonical 6: tinyllama 110.8,
   qwen3-0.6b 89.8, qwen3-1.7b 62.2, mistral-7b-q4ks 35.0,
   llama-3.1-8b-iq3m 27.2, qwen3-8b-iq3m 27.2. Smaller-fleet
   (smollm2-360m, qwen3-4b) and profile-mode pins kept in separate
   sub-blocks. "Canonical 6" promoted from inline-prose to
   header-block-vocabulary as the ship-gate fleet for every rebase
   + sweep cycle.

8. ~~**docs/BENCHMARKS.md tier expansion.**~~ **DONE 2026-04-28**
   (commit `ffefa00`) — added 7B+ entries (Mistral-7B Q4_K_S,
   Llama-3.1-8B IQ3_M, Qwen3-8B IQ3_M, Mistral-7B Q3_K_M); moved
   Qwen3 4B from Quality → Balanced based on measured 35.5 tok/s;
   moved Qwen3 1.7B from Balanced → Fast based on measured 62.2;
   added Decode tok/s column to all tier tables; bolded the
   canonical 6 entries to distinguish ship-gate fleet from wave-1
   / arch-survey entries; added explicit "Wave-1 deferred" footer
   for Gemma 2 2B and Phi-3.5 Mini.

9. ~~**CLAUDE.md doctrine capture from §27-§32a.**~~ **DONE
   2026-04-28** (commit `c514bce`) — promoted three doctrines
   from TODO process-notes to CLAUDE.md "Workflow policies":
   - **Rebase + sweep cycle doctrine** with the three template
     outcomes (§27 free win, §28 negative result, §32 small
     regression accepted) and matching decision rules.
   - **Cap-probe doctrine** (§31b lesson — bump first,
     characterize second).
   - **Pre-rebase baseline doctrine** (§32a lesson — same-model
     pre/post bucket comparison beats cross-model proxy).
   Both #2 and #3 cite closure reports as evidence anchors. The
   doctrines now survive context decay and session resets.

1. ~~**§32a — Profile-mode rebench on `llama-3.1-8b-iq3m`**.~~
   **CLOSED 2026-04-28 — hypothesis rejected, §32 baseline
   accepted as final.** Ran `make smoke-bench
   PERF_MODEL=llama-3.1-8b-instruct-iq3m PERF_RUNS=3` against
   the §32 rebased base (llama.cpp tip `c4af89356`). Captured
   156-step profile trace. Buckets: matmul **23.02 ms / 57.3%**,
   encode **4.01 ms / 10.0%**, attention **0.63 ms / 1.6%**,
   dispatch **652/token**, profile-mode tok/s **23.5**
   (perturbation -13.6% vs §32's 27.2 non-profile, normal band
   for this model class). **Bucket profile is structurally
   identical to qwen3-8b-iq3m's post-§27 reference within
   measurement noise** (matmul Δ -0.3%, dispatch delta tracks
   layer-count delta exactly: 652 = 32 × ~20.4; 805 = 36 × ~22.4).
   No bucket sticks out as the locus of the -6% regression. **H1
   "tied-embedding × #22456 aliasing-refactor" rejected** — would
   predict matmul or encode-overhead asymmetry vs untied Qwen3-8B
   reference; opposite is observed (Llama's lm_head matmul is
   *faster* per element). **H2 "buffer-aliasing constant
   overhead" supported** — uniform per-step overhead distributed
   across the pipeline; not bucket-localized. Decision rule's
   "uniform → accept and move on" branch fires. Closure report:
   `eval/reports/llama-cpp-rebase-2026-04-28-eve/PROFILE-32A.md`.
   New canonical reference pin: `llama-3.1-8b-iq3m` profile-mode
   23.5 tok/s / 156-step trace, alongside `qwen3-8b-iq3m`'s
   22.0 tok/s / 805 dispatch — these now form a matched 8B IQ3_M
   pair for any future post-rebase probe.
   **Process improvement noted for next rebase:** when the sweep
   classifies as "small regression, accepted" (§32 template),
   capture pre-rebase profile-mode on the regressing model
   *before* doing the rebase. Cost: ~3 min wall. Pay-off:
   §32a-style follow-on gets a same-model baseline (would have
   diagnosed conclusively here rather than via the cross-model
   proxy).

2. ~~**§31b — `MAXIMUM_MEMORY` upper-bound probe**.~~ **CLOSED
   2026-04-28 — toolchain ceiling identified at 16 GiB; Chrome
   runtime cap unmeasurable from this toolchain.** Bumped
   `-sMAXIMUM_MEMORY` to `64GB` in the `webllm-wasm-mem64` ctor
   block; build failed at link time:
   `wasm-ld: error: maximum memory too large, cannot be greater
   than 17179869184` (= **16 GiB exactly**, 2^34). Emscripten
   5.0.6's wasm-ld enforces a hard 16 GiB ceiling on
   `--max-memory`, regardless of the wasm spec's 256 TiB
   theoretical limit or Chrome v8 wasm64's actual runtime cap.
   §31a's "configured-ceiling-bound, not hardware-bound" framing
   is correct but understates the constraint: **the configuration
   ceiling is the toolchain ceiling, not a project knob.** §31a's
   15 GiB measurement was therefore at the maximum any current
   Emscripten build can configure. Implications for the 30B
   migration scope: 30B IQ3_M working set (12.8 GiB weights + KV
   + activations) can land at ~14.8-15.8 GiB on long-context
   workloads, **within margin of error of the toolchain ceiling**
   — the 30B migration inherits a "track the linker cap on every
   Emscripten upgrade" tracking item. Mitigation paths if the cap
   bites: lower-bit quant (IQ2_XXS / IQ2_S regains 4-5 GiB), cap
   context window, wait for upstream Emscripten to lift, or
   custom wasm-ld patch. **Process improvement noted:** when a
   cap is hit at a configurable value, immediately bump it to
   confirm whether the cap is configuration- or toolchain-bound;
   §31a's report would have been clearer with this 2-minute
   inline check. Edits reverted (zero net code change). Closure
   report: `eval/reports/memory64-probe-2026-04-28/SUMMARY-31b.md`.

3. ~~**Patch 12 squash cleanup** on `webllm-browser-patches`.~~
   **DONE 2026-04-28** — patch 12 (§32 forward fix-up) folded
   back into patch 3 via cherry-pick chain on a temp branch;
   trees byte-identical pre/post squash; new branch tip
   `3b8ade2a2` (was `c4af89356`); patch stack now **11 patches**
   (down from 12). WASM rebuild byte-identical at 2,249,650
   bytes; checkall 428/11/0 unchanged. Safety branches retained:
   `webllm-browser-patches-pre-squash-2026-04-28` (pre-squash
   tip `c4af89356`) and `webllm-browser-patches-pre-rebase-
   2026-04-28-eve` (pre-§32 tip `981859864`). Doc updated:
   `docs/LLAMA_CPP_PATCHES.md` (count line 12 → 11; patch 12
   section removed; §32 narrative augmented with squash-pass
   note).

---

**Fresh optional items (post-§31b housekeeping).** All three closed
2026-04-28 — closure entries preserved below for reference.

4. ~~**Dashboard refresh sweep on the 6-model fleet.**~~ **DONE
   2026-04-28** — `bun run eval/bench.ts --profiles "<list>"` on the
   canonical fleet (tinyllama-warm, qwen3-0.6b off/on × cold/warm,
   qwen3-1.7b off/on warm, mistral-7b-v0.3-warm, llama-3.1-8b-warm,
   qwen3-8b-warm/thinking-warm — 11 profiles total). 19/20 PASS;
   1 transient timeout on qwen3-0.6b-thinking-cold speed retried
   PASS (cold model warmup window). DB went 148 → 182 runs / 34 → 45
   evals; all 9 canonical model/thinking cells refreshed with
   2026-04-28 entries. Smoke-harness throughput numbers are 15-25%
   below `perf.ts` steady-state pins (CLAUDE.md harness-overhead
   note): tinyllama 84.8, qwen3-0.6b off 66.4 / on 65.0,
   qwen3-1.7b off 41.6 / on 45.2, mistral-7b 29.3, llama-3.1-8b 23.6,
   qwen3-8b off 22.0 / on 22.7. **§16's "16.2 tok/s" pin for
   qwen3-8b-iq3m on the dashboard is now superseded** by 22.7 tok/s
   (smoke harness) and the post-§27 27.2 tok/s perf.ts steady-state.
   Zero `src/` change; DB is gitignored (per `eval/reports/`).

5. ~~**Pre-rebase profile-mode capture on the canonical 6.**~~ **DONE
   2026-04-28** — `make smoke-bench PERF_MODEL=<m> PERF_RUNS=3` on
   each canonical model; logs + SUMMARY in
   `eval/reports/pre-rebase-baselines-2026-04-28/`. Headline pins
   (3-run median, profile-mode):

   | Model                      | tok/s | matmul (med, %) | dispatch |
   |---|---:|---:|---:|
   | tinyllama-1.1b-q4_0        | 87.9  | 3.74 / 37.8%    | 450 |
   | qwen3-0.6b-q8              | 68.2  | 3.87 / 33.6%    | 629 |
   | qwen3-1.7b-q8              | 44.0  | 6.75 / 36.9%    | 629 |
   | mistral-7b-v0.3-q4ks       | 29.7  | 15.86 / 48.7%   | 650 |
   | llama-3.1-8b-iq3m          | 23.5  | 23.00 / 57.5%   | 652 |
   | qwen3-8b-iq3m              | 21.8  | 23.20 / 55.4%   | 805 |

   llama-3.1-8b is bit-identical to §32a's PROFILE-32A.md (same-day
   reproducibility verified). Use when next upstream `ggml-webgpu`
   rebase trigger fires: same-model pre/post bucket comparison
   beats §32a's cross-model proxy. Freshness window: ~1 month;
   re-capture if rebase ETA slips. SUMMARY.md in the directory
   carries the full procedure + use-case + cross-references against
   §27 / §32 baselines.

6. ~~**§32 SUMMARY cross-link refresh.**~~ **DONE 2026-04-28**
   (commit `439bf7a`) — appended §10 "Post-cycle updates" stanza
   to `eval/reports/llama-cpp-rebase-2026-04-28-eve/SUMMARY.md`
   pointing at PROFILE-32A.md (H1 rejected / H2 supported), the
   patch-12 squash commit (`2850291`, stack 12 → 11), and §31b
   (16 GiB Emscripten 5.0.6 wasm-ld toolchain ceiling). Future
   readers landing on §32 closure see follow-up outcomes inline.

### Watch list / optional cadence work (2026-04-28)

Backlog is fully cleared. Upstream cadence check 2026-04-28: 2 commits
since `f9f33654a` (Nemotron Nano 3 Omni model support; `common/`
reasoning-budget helper) — **neither touches `ggml/src/ggml-webgpu/`**;
no rebase trigger near firing. Below items are honest candidates if
appetite remains; none are forced.

10. ~~**Vault-save the project's reusable doctrines.**~~ **DONE
    2026-04-28** — 5 notes landed:
    - `Patterns/rebase-and-sweep-cycle-template.md` (§27 / §28 / §32
      templates with decision rules)
    - `Patterns/cap-probe-bump-first-doctrine.md` (§31b lesson —
      bump first, characterize second)
    - `Patterns/pre-rebase-baseline-doctrine.md` (§32a lesson —
      same-model pre/post bucket comparison)
    - `Patterns/patch-stack-squash-via-cherry-pick-chain.md`
      (post-§32 patch-12 cleanup; confidence gate = artifact
      byte-identity pre/post)
    - `Knowledge/wasm-webgpu-encoder-fixed-cost-per-dispatch.md`
      (~5.2-5.7 µs/dispatch flat across the canonical 6 fleet)

    Probe-first doctrine generalization deliberately *not* duplicated
    — `Patterns/probe-first-methodology-validates-architecture-pivots.md`
    (2026-04-28, pre-existing) already covers the general doctrine
    via the §31 wasm64 narrative. The 5 new notes cross-link to it.
    Index rebuilt: 3056 notes / 970 tags / 9 MANIFESTs. All 5 notes
    verified in their respective folder MANIFESTs.

**Watch-list items (no action now; flag for next session):**

- **Pre-rebase baseline freshness window.** `eval/reports/pre-rebase-
  baselines-2026-04-28/` matrix is fresh as of 2026-04-28; freshness
  window ~1 month. **Re-capture if no rebase triggers fire by
  ~2026-05-28** — if the matrix ages past freshness without being
  consumed, the §32a process-improvement value evaporates.
  Procedure: `make smoke-bench PERF_MODEL=<m> PERF_RUNS=3` × 6
  canonical models, ~18 min wall. Only do this on the "stale-matrix
  + still-no-rebase-ETA" branch; otherwise let the next rebase
  trigger consume the matrix and start a fresh capture.
- **Upstream cadence check.** Today: 2 commits, 0 in `ggml-webgpu/`.
  Procedure: `cd ~/Repos/llama.cpp && git fetch origin && git log
  webllm-browser-patches..origin/master --oneline -- ggml/src/
  ggml-webgpu/ ggml/include/`. **If the result is non-empty**, a
  rebase trigger has fired — apply the §32 procedure (rebase, sweep,
  classify per §27/§28/§32 templates). **If empty**, log and skip.
  Reasonable cadence: every 1-2 weeks of active development; ad-hoc
  otherwise.
- **Test skip count.** Currently 11 (all environmental — indexedDB
  unavailable in Bun native, WebGPU unavailable in Bun native,
  WordPiece HF fixtures not downloaded, side-branch spec-decode
  tests). Watch for changes; new skips might indicate accidental
  test regressions.

### External-trigger candidates

Three open candidates, all conditional:

- **MEMORY64 full bridge migration** (P2-class spec). Trigger:
  a 13B or 30B target lands as a real deployment ask. Scope: (i)
  replace stdlib `malloc`/`free` at every JS call site with
  `_bridge_malloc` / `_bridge_free`, (ii) audit `int32_t
  size`/offset params in `webgpu-bridge.cpp` for >2 GiB transfer
  signatures, (iii) keep BigInt offsets across the GGUF loader's
  JS↔WASM boundary, (iv) re-run smoke + bench-inf + bench-profile
  under MEMORY64 to confirm zero regression on the existing
  ≤4 GiB fleet, (v) decide single-binary vs dual-binary deploy.
  Probe phase complete (§31 + §31a — `eval/reports/memory64-
  probe-2026-04-28/SUMMARY-31a.md`); ASYNCIFY × MEMORY64 risk
  axis retired; BigInt ABI gap closed; 15 GiB cap viable.

- **§D concat-graph batched encoder compute.** Trigger: a real
  batch-encoder-throughput use-case (was non-goal in §21). The
  encoder is dispatch-bound; the only structural lever left is
  amortizing dispatches across a batched concat-graph. §27
  rebase didn't deliver an encoder-side free win.

- **Upstream `ggml-webgpu` rebase + free-win sweep.** Trigger:
  upstream actually moves on the `ggml-webgpu/` surface again.
  Running base is now `f9f33654a` (post-§32). Mechanical sweep
  on the 6-model fleet against the new baselines (tinyllama-q4_0
  ~107, qwen3-0.6b ~87, qwen3-1.7b ~61, mistral-7b-q4ks ~35,
  llama-3.1-8b-iq3m ~27, qwen3-8b-iq3m ~26). Three documented
  outcome templates: §27 (free-win), §28 (negative result, lever
  closed harder), §32 (small regression, accepted). Pick the
  template that matches the data and document.

### Deferred (out of scope per current ceilings)

- **§C-v2-A resurrection.** Side branch `feat/spec-decode-v2-greedy`
  retains the entire driver, AdaptiveGate, K+1 verify, contract gate,
  and ~30 tests. The only remaining theoretical resurrection path is
  a 70B+ target via MEMORY64 (target/drafter ratio 13× → ~100×), but
  the 30B project ceiling (set 2026-04-28) defers that. Tip
  `4e11d79`. **Do not merge.** Re-evaluate only if the 30B ceiling
  lifts.

- **Wave-1 architectures Gemma 2, Phi 3.** 5+ gaps for Gemma; mostly
  fused-QKV for Phi 3. Re-evaluate if a model in either family lands
  as a real deployment ask.

### Process notes

- For any non-trivial lever pick, the established pattern is:
  invoke `superpowers:writing-plans` with the chosen scope, then
  execute via `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` (per
  global preference). Mirror §17/§18/§19/§20 plan structure:
  explicit phases, measurable gates, measure-and-close decision
  rule.
- Probes (§29, §32a, §31b) are short enough to skip the formal
  plan cycle and execute inline against the existing spec /
  closure reports — match the §29 verify-cost-probe pattern (one
  agentchrome js-exec or one make-target run, one writeup
  commit, done).
- **Cap probes — bump first, characterize second** (lesson from
  §31b). When a measurement hits a cap at a configurable value,
  immediately try bumping the configuration to confirm whether
  the cap is configuration-bound or toolchain/runtime-bound. The
  bump is cheap (1 line + 1 rebuild attempt). §31a missed this
  step and landed a "configured-ceiling-bound, not hardware-
  bound" framing that understated the constraint by one layer
  (the configuration ceiling *was* the toolchain ceiling).
- **Pre-rebase baselines** (lesson from §32a). When a rebase
  cycle plans a `bench` sweep for outcome classification, capture
  profile-mode traces on the same model fleet pre-rebase. Post-
  rebase regressions that classify as "small, accepted" can then
  be diagnosed via same-model pre/post deltas instead of cross-
  model proxies. ~15 min one-time cost; saves a follow-on probe
  when a regression fires.
- **History rewrites for forward fix-ups** (lesson from §32 →
  patch-12-squash). When a rebase produces a semantic conflict
  resolved by a forward-fix-up commit (rather than amending the
  upstream-touching patch in place to avoid history rewriting),
  schedule a squash cleanup pass in a follow-on cycle. The squash
  is mechanically: cherry-pick chain on a temp branch with
  `cherry-pick --no-commit <fixup>` followed by `commit --amend
  --no-edit` to fold the fixup into its target. Confidence gate
  is **WASM byte-identity pre/post squash** — if the artifact
  matches, the squash is semantically a no-op and safe to swap.

#### Archived: How to test §A lever 1 — see `TODO_ARCHIVE.md`

Closed 2026-04-26 — §17. Full pre-change baseline shell snippet,
expected-results map, and reproduction instructions preserved in
the archive.

#### Operational gotchas

- **Cold-shader artifact.** The smoke page does a shader-
  cache warmup after [6/8] engine adoption. If you see
  "1.0 tok/s" after a fresh WASM rebuild, the warmup
  didn't run — investigate before investigating "the
  engine."
- **Bench-profile timeout on 8B+.** If chat-smoke times
  out at 180s, run `make smoke-stop && make smoke-restart`
  to clear stale agentchrome state, then retry. Not a
  regression in the bench harness.
- **`make smoke-bench` bundles `--profile`; `make
  bench-inference` does not.** Use the former for backend
  attribution (perturbs timing); the latter for canonical
  steady-state tok/s. The §16 entry has both for qwen3-8b.

### Historical context, Active next steps, Deferred kernel-tuning targets — see `TODO_ARCHIVE.md`

The Apr-23 smoke-bench regression diagnosis (resolved 2026-04-25 —
sampler-config methodology change, not an engine regression), the
§1-§10 active-next-steps work that drove the wave-1 + wave-2 model
campaigns through 2026-04-26, and the deferred §A-§D kernel-tuning
target portfolio (now all closed via §17 / §19 / §20 / §21 / §24 /
§26) live in `TODO_ARCHIVE.md`. Items 11-12 (3+ binding buffer-
conflict edge case; JSPI feasibility checkpoint) are also archived
there as latent follow-ups, not active work.

## Local Dependencies

This repo depends on a local patched llama.cpp at `~/Repos/llama.cpp/` on branch
**`webllm-browser-patches`**. Patches (full inventory in `docs/LLAMA_CPP_PATCHES.md`):
1. `ggml: iterative ggml_visit_parents_graph for WASM stack safety`
2. `ggml-webgpu: browser + ASYNCIFY support bundle`
3. `ggml-webgpu: request-based browser readback API`
4. `ggml-webgpu: harden async readback request cleanup`
5. `ggml-webgpu: notify browser async readback completion`
6. `ggml-webgpu: add opt-in browser graph profiling`
7. `ggml-webgpu: specialize browser decode matmul dispatch` (paired with patch 8)
8. `Revert "ggml-webgpu: specialize browser decode matmul dispatch"` (effective no-op vs patch 6)
9. `ggml-webgpu: add GGML_OP_NORM (LayerNorm) support` — load-bearing for the BERT encoder path; without it `engine.embed()` returns bit-identical output for every input.
